# Adult Maintenance Nutrition

## Overview

The adult maintenance stage constitutes the majority of a companion parrot's life, spanning from sexual maturity to the onset of senior age. During this stage, the bird's nutritional needs focus on maintaining optimal body condition, supporting immune health, preserving organ function, and preventing the chronic diseases associated with improper diet. A balanced diet based on formulated pellets with daily fresh foods is the cornerstone of adult maintenance nutrition.

## Nutritional Requirements

| Nutrient | Recommended Level (Dry Matter Basis) |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| Protein | 10-15% |
| Fat | 4-8% (lower for obesity-prone species) |
| Fiber | 3-8% |
| Calcium | 0.3-0.7% |
| Phosphorus | 0.3-0.5% |
| Vitamin A | 5,000-10,000 IU/kg diet |
| Vitamin D3 | 500-2,000 IU/kg diet |

*Requirements vary by species. Consult species-specific diet guides for precise recommendations.*

## Ideal Adult Diet Composition

### Pellets: 50-70% of Total Diet
- Formulated pellets provide the nutritional base, ensuring consistent intake of all essential nutrients.
- Select pellets appropriate for the bird's species and size.
- Offer pellets in a clean dish, refreshing daily.

### Fresh Vegetables: 20-30%
- Serve daily. Emphasize dark leafy greens and orange/yellow vegetables rich in beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor).
- Rotate varieties to provide a broad spectrum of phytonutrients and prevent monotony.
- Prepare fresh each day and remove uneaten portions after 2-4 hours.

### Fresh Fruits: 5-10%
- Offer in moderation due to sugar content.
- Use as enrichment and variety rather than a dietary staple.
- Berries, apple, melon, and tropical fruits are appropriate choices.

### Seeds, Nuts, and Treats: 5% or Less
- Use primarily for training rewards and foraging enrichment.
- Nuts (almonds, walnuts, pine nuts) are calorie-dense and should be limited.
- Sunflower seeds and peanuts should be minimal due to high fat content.

## Caloric Balance and Weight Management

- Adult maintenance diets should provide adequate calories to maintain ideal body weight without promoting obesity.
- **Weigh your bird regularly** (weekly to monthly) using a gram scale to detect gradual weight changes.
- Obesity is a prevalent problem in companion parrots, particularly Amazon parrots, cockatoos, budgerigars, and cockatiels, and is directly linked to cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, lipomas, and reduced lifespan.
- If a bird is gaining weight, reduce seed/nut intake and increase vegetables and activity/flight time.

## Water

- Fresh, clean water must be available at all times and changed at least twice daily.
- Water dishes should be washed daily and disinfected weekly.

## Supplements for Adults

For birds eating a balanced pellet-based diet with fresh foods, additional supplementation is generally unnecessary. Exceptions include:
- **Cuttlebone / mineral block**: Should always be available for calcium and beak conditioning.
- **African Grey Parrots**: May benefit from supplemental calcium due to species-specific hypocalcemia risk.
- **Birds still transitioning from seed diets**: May need targeted vitamin/mineral supplementation under veterinary guidance.
- **UVB lighting**: Essential for indoor birds to maintain adequate vitamin D3 levels.

## Molting Support

- Adult birds molt 1-2 times per year, replacing their feathers over a period of weeks to months.
- During active molting, slightly increase protein-rich foods (cooked eggs, legumes, pellets) to support feather keratin production.
- Ensure adequate bathing opportunities to support feather health and relieve discomfort from pin feathers.

## Common Nutritional Pitfalls in Adults

- **Over-reliance on seeds**: The most common dietary error, leading to vitamin A deficiency, calcium deficiency, obesity, and liver disease.
- **Too many treats**: Nuts, seeds, and human food treats add excessive calories and fat.
- **Insufficient vegetables**: Many owners offer mostly fruit (which is sugary) rather than the more nutritionally dense vegetables.
- **"Table food" sharing**: While some human foods are safe and appropriate (plain cooked grains, vegetables), many are not (salty, fried, processed foods, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol).
- **Monotonous diet**: Even a balanced diet becomes problematic if limited to only one or two foods. Variety supports complete nutrition and mental enrichment.
