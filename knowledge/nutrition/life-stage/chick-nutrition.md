# Chick & Hand-feeding Nutrition

## Overview

Proper nutrition during the chick stage is critical for healthy growth, development, and long-term health of companion parrots. Chicks have rapidly developing skeletal, organ, and feather systems that demand precise nutritional support. Hand-feeding (hand-rearing) is a common practice in aviculture, where chicks are removed from the nest and fed by human caregivers using specialized formula. While hand-feeding can produce well-socialized companion birds, it carries significant risks if done improperly, including crop burns, aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and stunted growth.

## Nutritional Requirements of Chicks

- **High protein**: Chicks require 18-25% protein (dry matter basis) to support rapid tissue growth, muscle development, and feather formation.
- **Adequate fat**: 8-15% fat for energy density and essential fatty acid supply.
- **Calcium and phosphorus**: Critical for skeletal development. Proper calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (approximately 1.5-2:1) is essential to prevent metabolic bone disease.
- **Vitamin D3**: Required for calcium absorption and bone mineralization.
- **Vitamin A**: Supports immune development, epithelial tissue growth, and vision.
- **B vitamins**: Essential for energy metabolism and nervous system development.

## Commercial Hand-Feeding Formulas

- Use only commercially produced hand-feeding formulas designed specifically for parrots. These are nutritionally balanced for the growth requirements of psittacine chicks.
- Popular brands include Kaytee Exact, Zupreem Embrace, Lafeber's Premium Daily Diet Hand-Feeding Formula, and Roudybush Formula 3.
- **Never use homemade formulas, baby cereal, or human food** as hand-feeding diet. These lack the precise nutritional balance chicks require and can cause serious health problems.

## Hand-Feeding Technique

### Temperature
- Formula should be heated to **38-40°C (100-104°F)** before feeding. Use a thermometer every time.
- Formula that is too hot (>41°C / 106°F) causes **crop burns**, a severe and potentially fatal injury.
- Formula that is too cold causes **crop stasis** (slow crop emptying), which can lead to bacterial or yeast overgrowth.

### Consistency
- Younger chicks (1-2 weeks) require a thinner consistency.
- Older chicks (3+ weeks) can be fed a slightly thicker consistency.
- Follow the manufacturer's mixing instructions for the specific formula.

### Feeding Method
- **Syringe feeding**: Most common method. Use a curved-tip syringe to deliver formula into the left side of the chick's mouth, allowing the chick to swallow naturally.
- **Spoon feeding**: Some breeders prefer spoon-feeding, which allows the chick to eat at its own pace. Slower but reduces aspiration risk.
- **Never force-feed**: Allow the chick's feeding response (bobbing head motion) to guide the feeding.

### Feeding Schedule by Age

| Age | Feeds per Day | Notes |
|-----|---------------|-------|
| 1-2 weeks | 5-6 times | Every 3-4 hours, including early morning and late evening |
| 2-3 weeks | 4-5 times | Every 4-5 hours |
| 3-5 weeks | 3-4 times | Every 5-6 hours |
| 5-8 weeks | 2-3 times | Begin introducing solid foods alongside formula |
| 8+ weeks | 1-2 times | Actively weaning, most nutrition from solid food |

*Schedules vary by species. Larger species (macaws, cockatoos) wean much later than small species (budgerigars, lovebirds).*

## Crop Monitoring

- The crop should be checked before each feeding. The crop should be mostly empty (or nearly so) before the next feeding.
- A crop that fails to empty within the expected timeframe (crop stasis) may indicate: formula too cold, infection (bacterial or yeast), dehydration, or environmental temperature too low.
- A distended, discolored, or malodorous crop is a medical emergency requiring immediate veterinary attention.

## Weaning

- Weaning is the transition from hand-feeding formula to solid foods (pellets, fresh foods, and small amounts of seed).
- **Never force-wean** by abruptly withdrawing formula. Allow the chick to gradually reduce formula consumption as it learns to eat independently.
- Offer a variety of soft foods alongside formula: warm softened pellets, chopped vegetables, cooked grains, and sprouted seeds.
- Monitor weight daily during weaning. Some weight loss (up to 10-15% of peak weight) is normal during weaning as the chick becomes more active.
- Species-specific weaning ages range from approximately 6-8 weeks (budgerigars, lovebirds) to 4-6 months (macaws, cockatoos).

## Common Problems

- **Crop burns**: From overheated formula. Requires veterinary treatment and may need surgical repair.
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: From formula entering the trachea. Caused by improper feeding technique or feeding a struggling chick.
- **Crop stasis / slow crop**: Bacterial or yeast infection, cold formula, or environmental temperature too low.
- **Stunted growth**: From inadequate feeding frequency, insufficient formula concentration, or nutritional deficiency.
- **Metabolic bone disease**: From calcium/vitamin D3 deficiency in the formula or improper formula preparation.
