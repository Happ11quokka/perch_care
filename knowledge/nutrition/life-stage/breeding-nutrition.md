# Breeding & Egg-laying Nutrition

## Overview

Breeding and egg-laying place extraordinary nutritional demands on companion parrots, particularly on the female. Egg formation requires massive mobilization of calcium, protein, fat, and other nutrients, and nutritional inadequacy during breeding is one of the leading causes of egg binding, soft-shelled eggs, reproductive failure, and maternal health complications. Both breeding males and females benefit from enhanced nutrition before, during, and after the breeding season.

## Increased Nutritional Demands

### Calcium
- Egg shell formation is the single greatest calcium demand in a hen's life. Each egg shell requires 1-2 grams of calcium, primarily as calcium carbonate.
- Without adequate dietary calcium, the hen's body mobilizes calcium from her own bones (medullary bone reserves), leading to osteoporosis, pathological fractures, and hypocalcemia.
- **Recommendation**: Begin calcium supplementation 2-4 weeks before anticipated breeding. Provide cuttlebone, mineral blocks, liquid calcium supplements, and calcium-rich vegetables (kale, broccoli, bok choy).

### Protein
- Egg formation requires significant protein for albumin (egg white) and embryonic tissue development.
- Both parents need increased protein to support breeding activity and chick rearing.
- **Recommendation**: Increase protein to 16-22% of the diet (dry matter basis). Offer cooked eggs, cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas), and high-protein pellet formulations.

### Fat
- Egg yolk is predominantly fat and requires increased dietary fat for production.
- **Recommendation**: Moderately increase fat intake through small amounts of nuts, seeds, and egg yolk. Avoid excessive fat that could lead to obesity.

### Vitamin A
- Essential for reproductive tissue health, embryonic development, and immune function in both parents and chicks.
- **Recommendation**: Increase vitamin A-rich foods: sweet potato, carrots, bell peppers, dark leafy greens.

### Vitamin D3
- Required for calcium absorption and proper egg shell calcification.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure adequate UVB light exposure or veterinarian-guided D3 supplementation.

### Vitamin E
- Supports fertility in both sexes and embryonic survival.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure adequate intake from pellets, leafy greens, and wheat germ.

## Pre-Breeding Conditioning

Begin dietary enhancement 4-6 weeks before the anticipated breeding season:

1. **Switch to a breeding/high-potency pellet formula** if available (e.g., Harrison's High Potency).
2. **Increase fresh food variety and volume**: More vegetables, cooked eggs, sprouted seeds, and legumes.
3. **Ensure calcium supplementation is in place**: Cuttlebone always available; consider liquid calcium for species prone to hypocalcemia.
4. **Provide adequate UVB lighting** for vitamin D3 synthesis.
5. **Ensure both birds are at healthy body weight**: Underweight or obese birds have reduced fertility and increased complications.

## During Egg-Laying and Incubation

- **Continue enhanced nutrition** throughout egg-laying and incubation.
- Hens laying multiple eggs in a clutch have sustained calcium and energy demands over days to weeks.
- Ensure the hen has access to food near the nest box so she can eat without leaving eggs for extended periods.
- Soft, warm foods (cooked sweet potato, scrambled egg, warm mash) are especially appreciated during this period.

## Chick-Rearing Nutrition

- Parent-rearing birds need substantially increased food intake to produce crop milk (regurgitated food) for their chicks.
- High-protein, nutrient-dense foods should be offered abundantly: soaked or sprouted seeds, cooked eggs, legumes, pellets, and fresh vegetables.
- Fresh food should be replaced multiple times daily to maintain freshness and safety for both parents and chicks.

## Chronic Egg-Laying Management

For single female birds that lay eggs chronically (without a mate):
- **Do NOT increase calcium proactively** unless the bird is actively laying, as supplemental calcium can sometimes stimulate further egg production.
- **Reduce daylight hours** to 10-12 hours to suppress hormonal triggers.
- **Remove eggs only after the full clutch is laid** (or replace with dummy eggs) to avoid triggering replacement laying.
- **Consult an avian veterinarian** for hormonal management options if chronic laying persists despite environmental modification.

## Nutritional Complications of Breeding

- **Egg binding**: Primarily caused by calcium deficiency, dehydration, or poor muscle tone. A medical emergency.
- **Egg yolk peritonitis**: Yolk material entering the abdomen due to reproductive tract dysfunction.
- **Hypocalcemia**: Muscle weakness, tremors, seizures from calcium depletion.
- **Osteoporosis**: Chronic calcium depletion weakening bones.
- **Obesity in non-breeding birds**: Over-supplementation when not actively breeding can lead to weight gain.
