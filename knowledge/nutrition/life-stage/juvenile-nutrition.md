# Juvenile & Weaning Nutrition

## Overview

The juvenile stage spans from weaning (when a bird transitions from hand-feeding formula to solid food) through to sexual maturity. This is a critical developmental period during which companion parrots establish lifelong dietary preferences and complete their physical growth. Proper nutrition during the juvenile stage supports continued skeletal development, feather growth (including the first adult molt), immune system maturation, and behavioral development. The dietary habits established during this period often persist throughout the bird's life, making it the ideal time to introduce a varied, balanced diet.

## Nutritional Requirements

- **Protein**: 14-18% (dry matter basis). Still elevated compared to adult maintenance to support ongoing growth and the first molt.
- **Fat**: 6-10%. Sufficient for energy and essential fatty acids without promoting excessive weight gain.
- **Calcium**: Continued importance for skeletal maturation. Cuttlebone and mineral blocks should be available.
- **Vitamins**: Full spectrum from pelleted diet and fresh foods. Vitamin A from orange/yellow vegetables and dark leafy greens is particularly important.

## Weaning Diet Composition

The weaning diet should introduce the same food categories the bird will eat throughout its adult life:

### Pellets (50-70% of diet)
- Begin with softened pellets (moistened with warm water) to ease the transition from formula.
- Gradually offer dry pellets as the bird's beak strength and coordination develop.
- This is the best time to establish pellet acceptance -- birds that learn to eat pellets during weaning rarely have conversion difficulties later.

### Fresh Vegetables (20-30%)
- Introduce a wide variety of vegetables during weaning. Birds are most receptive to new foods during this developmental window.
- Offer finely chopped or grated vegetables: carrots, sweet potato, bell peppers, broccoli, peas, corn, dark leafy greens.
- Serve vegetables in different forms (raw, lightly steamed, chopped, whole) to encourage exploration and acceptance.

### Fresh Fruits (5-10%)
- Offer small amounts of fruit: apple, berries, melon, grapes, mango, papaya.
- Keep fruit portions smaller than vegetable portions due to higher sugar content.

### Seeds (Minimal)
- If seeds are introduced at all, limit to less than 10% of the diet.
- Use seeds primarily as training rewards, not as a dietary staple.
- Establishing a low-seed habit during the juvenile stage prevents the seed addiction that plagues many adult parrots.

## The "Fledgling Food Begging" Period

- Newly weaned juveniles may continue to beg for hand-feeding even when capable of eating independently. This is normal social behavior, not necessarily hunger.
- Monitor weight daily (using a gram scale) to distinguish between genuine hunger and social begging.
- Some regression (returning to hand-feeding after beginning to eat solid food) is normal. Do not panic or force the transition.
- Ensure solid food is always accessible, even while providing occasional supplemental formula feeds.

## Establishing Good Dietary Habits

The juvenile period is the **most important window** for dietary education:

- **Variety is key**: Birds that are exposed to many different foods during the juvenile stage are far more likely to accept a varied diet as adults.
- **Model eating behavior**: Eat meals near your bird. Parrots are social eaters and learn by observing their "flock."
- **Positive associations**: Offer new foods during positive social interactions.
- **Persistence**: A bird may need to see a new food 10-20 times before trying it. Continue offering rejected foods without forcing.
- **Avoid developing seed dependency**: Once a bird becomes addicted to high-fat seeds, conversion to a balanced diet is extremely difficult.

## Monitoring Growth

- Weigh the bird daily or every other day during weaning and weekly through the juvenile period.
- Juvenile weight gain follows a species-specific growth curve. Consult breeding references for expected weight ranges.
- A juvenile that fails to gain weight or loses weight excessively may have health issues (infection, malabsorption) requiring veterinary evaluation.

## First Molt

- Juvenile birds undergo their first molt at species-specific ages (typically 4-8 months for small parrots, 8-18 months for larger species).
- Molting increases nutritional demands, particularly for protein and amino acids (methionine and lysine) needed for feather keratin production.
- Ensure adequate protein intake through pellets, cooked eggs, and legumes during the molt.
- Bathing helps relieve the discomfort of pin feathers and supports feather development.
