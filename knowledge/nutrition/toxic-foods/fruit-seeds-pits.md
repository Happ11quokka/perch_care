# Fruit Seeds & Pits

## Overview

The seeds and pits of certain common fruits contain **cyanogenic glycosides** -- compounds that release hydrogen cyanide (HCN) when metabolized. While the small amounts present in individual seeds are unlikely to cause acute toxicity in a large parrot from a single seed, regular or significant ingestion can lead to chronic cyanide exposure. As a precaution, all fruit seeds and pits from the listed species should be removed before offering fruit to companion birds.

## Toxic Compound

- **Amygdalin** (a cyanogenic glycoside): Found in the seeds and pits of certain fruits. When ingested, amygdalin is metabolized by enzymes in the gut (beta-glucosidase) to release **hydrogen cyanide (HCN)**.
- Cyanide inhibits cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, blocking cellular aerobic respiration and causing cellular suffocation.

## Fruits with Toxic Seeds/Pits

| Fruit | Toxic Part | Cyanogenic Glycoside |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Apple | Seeds | Amygdalin |
| Pear | Seeds | Amygdalin |
| Cherry | Pit (stone) | Amygdalin |
| Peach | Pit (stone) | Amygdalin |
| Nectarine | Pit (stone) | Amygdalin |
| Plum | Pit (stone) | Amygdalin |
| Apricot | Pit (stone) | Amygdalin |

**Note**: The flesh of all these fruits is safe and nutritious for birds. Only the seeds and pits are of concern.

## Risk Level

- A single apple seed is unlikely to cause acute toxicity in a large parrot.
- However, small birds (budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds) are at greater risk due to their low body mass.
- **Chronic exposure** from regularly consuming seeds over time may accumulate harmful effects.
- The precautionary principle applies: remove all seeds and pits before offering these fruits to birds.

## Clinical Signs of Cyanide Toxicity

In cases of significant cyanide ingestion:
- Rapid breathing (tachypnea)
- Bright red mucous membranes (due to inability to utilize oxygen at cellular level)
- Weakness and lethargy
- Ataxia (incoordination)
- Seizures
- Respiratory distress
- Cardiac arrest and sudden death

## Prevention

- **Always core apples and pears** before offering to birds. Remove all seeds.
- **Always remove pits/stones** from cherries, peaches, nectarines, plums, and apricots before feeding.
- The fruit flesh is safe and should be offered as part of a healthy diet.
- Citrus seeds (orange, lemon, grapefruit) are not known to contain significant cyanogenic glycosides and are generally considered safe, though not typically consumed.
- Grape seeds are not toxic and grapes can be offered whole.

## Treatment

- If significant seed/pit ingestion is suspected, contact an avian veterinarian immediately.
- Treatment is supportive and may include crop lavage and activated charcoal.
- In severe cases, sodium thiosulfate may be used as a cyanide antidote under veterinary supervision.
