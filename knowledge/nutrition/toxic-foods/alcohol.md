# Alcohol Toxicity

## Overview

Alcohol (ethanol) is extremely toxic to birds. Due to their small body mass, rapid metabolism, and efficient respiratory system, even minute amounts of alcohol can cause severe intoxication, organ damage, and death in companion parrots. Birds can be exposed through alcoholic beverages, fermented fruits, and even alcohol-based household products. There is no safe amount of alcohol for birds.

## Toxic Compound

- **Ethanol (ethyl alcohol)**: The primary intoxicating compound in alcoholic beverages.
- Birds are far more sensitive to ethanol than mammals due to their small body size and high metabolic rate. A few drops of an alcoholic beverage can be toxic to a small bird.

## Sources of Exposure

- **Alcoholic beverages**: Beer, wine, spirits, cocktails, liqueurs.
- **Fermented fruits**: Overripe or rotting fruit can ferment naturally, producing ethanol. Birds with access to outdoor fruit trees or compost may be exposed.
- **Cooking with alcohol**: Foods containing wine, beer, or spirits may retain residual alcohol.
- **Alcohol-based household products**: Hand sanitizers, perfumes, mouthwash, and cleaning products.
- **Bread dough**: Raw yeast dough can ferment in the crop, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide.

## Mechanism of Toxicity

- Ethanol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier.
- It acts as a central nervous system depressant, causing sedation, loss of coordination, and respiratory depression.
- Ethanol also causes hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), metabolic acidosis, and hypothermia.
- In birds, the liver's capacity to metabolize ethanol is limited relative to the rapid absorption rate.

## Clinical Signs

Signs appear rapidly, often within minutes to hours:
- Disorientation and incoordination (ataxia)
- Drowsiness and lethargy
- Loss of balance, falling from perch
- Vomiting or regurgitation
- Diarrhea
- Respiratory depression (slow, shallow breathing)
- Hypothermia (low body temperature)
- Seizures
- Loss of consciousness
- Death from respiratory failure or cardiac arrest

## Treatment

- **Emergency veterinary care is essential**.
- Treatment is supportive:
  - Keep the bird warm (prevent hypothermia)
  - Intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy
  - Dextrose (glucose) administration for hypoglycemia
  - Assisted ventilation if respiratory depression occurs
  - Crop lavage if ingestion was very recent
- Recovery depends on the amount ingested and the speed of treatment. Small birds may not survive even small exposures.

## Prevention

- Never offer alcoholic beverages to birds, even as a "taste."
- Keep alcoholic drinks covered and away from birds during out-of-cage time.
- Remove overripe or fermenting fruit from the cage and from areas accessible to the bird.
- Do not use alcohol-based products in the immediate vicinity of birds.
- Ensure that raw bread dough is kept away from birds.
