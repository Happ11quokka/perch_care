# Chocolate & Caffeine Toxicity

## Overview

Chocolate and caffeine-containing products are toxic to companion birds due to their content of **methylxanthine** compounds -- specifically **theobromine** (in chocolate) and **caffeine** (in coffee, tea, cola, and chocolate). Birds are significantly more sensitive to methylxanthines than mammals due to their small body mass, rapid metabolism, and efficient absorption. Even small amounts can cause serious cardiovascular and neurological effects, and ingestion can be fatal.

Bird-specific lethal dose thresholds are not well established for most companion parrots, so any known or suspected ingestion should be treated as an emergency.

## Toxic Compounds

### Theobromine (Chocolate)
- Primary toxic compound in chocolate. Concentration varies by chocolate type:

| Chocolate Type | Theobromine Content |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Cocoa powder | 20-50 mg/g (highest) |
| Baking/unsweetened chocolate | 14-16 mg/g |
| Dark chocolate | 5-8 mg/g |
| Milk chocolate | 1.5-2.5 mg/g |
| White chocolate | Trace/very low (minimal theobromine) |

The darker and more concentrated the chocolate, the more dangerous it is.

### Dose Uncertainty in Birds
- There is no widely accepted avian LD50 for chocolate methylxanthines.
- Toxic risk therefore cannot be reliably assessed at home from "small amount" estimates.
- A published fatal avian case (Kea) reported estimated exposure around **250 mg/kg theobromine** and **20 mg/kg caffeine** after dark chocolate ingestion, illustrating that high-cocoa products are especially dangerous.

### Caffeine
- Found in coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, and chocolate.
- Caffeine is a more potent central nervous system stimulant than theobromine.
- Combined caffeine and theobromine exposure (as in chocolate) is more dangerous than either compound alone.

## Mechanism of Toxicity

Methylxanthines act by:
- **Inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes**, increasing intracellular cyclic AMP levels
- **Blocking adenosine receptors**, causing CNS stimulation
- **Increasing intracellular calcium**, affecting cardiac and skeletal muscle function
- The result is cardiovascular stimulation (tachycardia, arrhythmias), central nervous system hyperexcitation (tremors, seizures), and gastrointestinal irritation.

## Clinical Signs

Signs may appear within **1-4 hours** of ingestion:
- Hyperactivity and restlessness
- Increased heart rate (tachycardia) and cardiac arrhythmias
- Vomiting and diarrhea
- Tremors and muscle twitching
- Ataxia (incoordination)
- Seizures
- Increased urination (diuresis)
- Panting and increased respiratory rate
- Collapse and death in severe cases

## Treatment

- **Seek emergency veterinary care immediately** if ingestion is known or suspected.
- Treatment is supportive:
  - Crop lavage if ingestion was recent
  - Activated charcoal to reduce absorption
  - Intravenous fluids to support excretion and hydration
  - Anti-convulsants if seizures occur
  - Cardiac monitoring and anti-arrhythmic medications if needed
- Methylxanthines are metabolized slowly in birds, so monitoring should continue for 12-24+ hours.

## Prevention

- Never offer chocolate, coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, or any caffeine-containing products to birds.
- Be aware of hidden sources:
  - Chocolate-covered snacks, cookies, cake, ice cream
  - Coffee beans or grounds
  - Tea bags
  - Caffeinated sodas
  - Cocoa-dusted confections
- Secure these items away from birds during out-of-cage time.
- Never leave cups of coffee or tea accessible to free-roaming birds.
- Do not consider white chocolate "safe"; although methylxanthines are very low, it is still an inappropriate high-fat/high-sugar food for birds.
