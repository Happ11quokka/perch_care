# Onion, Garlic & Allium Toxicity

## Overview

All members of the *Allium* family -- including onions, garlic, leeks, shallots, chives, and scallions -- are toxic to birds. These plants contain **organosulfur compounds** (thiosulfinates and their derivatives) that cause oxidative damage to red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. While a small accidental exposure may not be immediately fatal, regular or significant ingestion can cause progressive red blood cell destruction and serious illness.

## Toxic Compounds

- **Thiosulfinates** (including allicin in garlic): These organosulfur compounds are released when allium plants are cut, crushed, or chewed.
- **N-propyl disulfide** and related disulfides: These compounds cause oxidative damage to hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming **Heinz bodies** (denatured hemoglobin inclusions).
- Heinz body formation leads to premature red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) and anemia.
- Both raw and cooked forms are toxic. Cooking does not eliminate the toxic compounds.

## Sources

- **Onion** (all types: white, red, yellow, sweet)
- **Garlic**
- **Leeks**
- **Shallots**
- **Chives**
- **Scallions (green onions)**
- **Onion/garlic powder** (concentrated and particularly dangerous even in small amounts)
- Foods prepared with these ingredients (soups, sauces, seasoned meats, bread, crackers)

## Clinical Signs

Signs may be delayed and develop gradually over days with chronic exposure:
- Weakness and lethargy
- Pale mucous membranes (indicating anemia)
- Increased respiratory rate
- Dark or discolored urates (brown/red tinge in droppings)
- Decreased appetite
- Vomiting or regurgitation
- In severe cases: collapse, respiratory distress, and death from severe anemia

## Diagnosis

- History of allium exposure
- Complete blood count showing anemia, Heinz bodies on blood smear
- Elevated liver enzymes in some cases

## Treatment

- Remove the source of exposure immediately.
- Seek veterinary care. Treatment is supportive:
  - Fluid therapy
  - Blood transfusion in severe anemia (rare in small birds but possible in larger species)
  - Nutritional support
  - Monitoring of packed cell volume (PCV) to track anemia progression

## Prevention

- Never feed onions, garlic, or any allium family member to birds.
- Be cautious with "garlic supplements for birds" marketed in some aviculture sources. While heavily debated, most avian veterinarians advise against garlic supplementation due to the known hemolytic potential.
- Check ingredient lists on human foods shared with birds -- onion and garlic powder are common hidden ingredients in crackers, chips, breads, soups, and sauces.
- Keep allium plants out of reach during food preparation and out-of-cage time.
