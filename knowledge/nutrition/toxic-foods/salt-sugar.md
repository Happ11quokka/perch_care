# Salt & High-Sodium Foods

## Overview

Excessive salt (sodium chloride) intake is dangerous for companion birds. Birds have a limited capacity to excrete excess sodium through their kidneys, making them vulnerable to salt toxicity even from amounts that would be harmless to humans. Many common human snack foods contain salt levels that can be toxic to small birds. While birds require trace amounts of sodium for normal physiological function, their needs are easily met through a balanced diet without supplementation.

## Physiological Sodium Needs

- Birds require small amounts of sodium for nerve impulse transmission, fluid balance, and muscle function.
- Normal dietary sodium requirements for companion parrots are approximately **0.1-0.3% of the diet** (dry matter basis).
- A balanced pelleted diet provides adequate sodium without supplementation.

## Sources of Excessive Salt

- **Salty snack foods**: Chips, crackers, pretzels, popcorn (salted), salted nuts
- **Processed foods**: Deli meats, cheese, canned vegetables (with added salt), bread, pizza
- **Condiments**: Soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, salad dressings
- **Table salt**: Added directly to food
- **Salt licks or mineral blocks** with high sodium content (choose products designed for birds, not livestock)
- **Salted butter or margarine**
- **Pickled foods**

## Clinical Signs of Salt Toxicity

- Excessive thirst (polydipsia) and increased water consumption
- Increased urination (polyuria) and watery droppings
- Depression and lethargy
- Tremors and muscle twitching
- Ataxia (incoordination)
- Seizures
- Kidney damage
- Death in severe cases

## Excessive Sugar

While not toxic in the same acute sense as salt, excessive dietary sugar can cause health problems:
- **Yeast overgrowth (candidiasis)**: High sugar promotes *Candida* growth in the crop and digestive tract, particularly in young or immunocompromised birds.
- **Obesity**: Sugar contributes to caloric excess.
- **Diabetes**: While rare in birds, chronic excessive sugar intake may contribute to metabolic dysfunction.
- **Dental/beak issues**: Not a direct concern in birds as they lack teeth, but sticky sugary foods can adhere to the beak and promote bacterial growth.

### Sources of Excessive Sugar
- Candy, cookies, cake, pastries
- Sweetened beverages (juice drinks, soda)
- Honey (also carries a risk of *Clostridium botulinum* spores)
- Excessive fruit in the diet
- Sweetened yogurt or ice cream

## Prevention

- Never offer salty human snack foods to birds.
- If sharing food with your bird, choose unsalted, plain versions.
- Read ingredient labels -- sodium content is listed on nutrition facts panels.
- Limit fruit portions to recommended levels (5-15% of diet, species-dependent).
- Avoid offering honey, candy, or other concentrated sugar sources.
- Choose bird-specific mineral blocks and supplements rather than livestock salt licks.

## Treatment

- For suspected salt toxicity, provide access to fresh water immediately and seek veterinary care.
- Treatment is supportive: fluid therapy to help excrete excess sodium, monitoring electrolytes, and treating seizures if present.
- Prognosis depends on the amount ingested and the speed of treatment.
