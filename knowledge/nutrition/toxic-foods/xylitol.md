# Xylitol & Artificial Sweeteners

## Overview

Xylitol is a sugar alcohol widely used as an artificial sweetener in sugar-free products. While xylitol toxicity is well-documented in dogs (causing severe hypoglycemia and liver failure), its effects on birds are less extensively studied. However, due to the known toxic potential in other species and the precautionary principle, xylitol and other artificial sweeteners should be avoided in avian diets. Birds gain no nutritional benefit from sweeteners, and the risk of adverse effects outweighs any potential palatability advantage.

## What Is Xylitol

- A naturally occurring sugar alcohol (polyol) found in small amounts in birch bark, corn cobs, and some fruits and vegetables.
- Commercially produced xylitol is widely used as a sugar substitute due to its sweetness (comparable to sucrose) with fewer calories and a low glycemic index for humans.

## Sources of Xylitol

- Sugar-free gum and mints
- Sugar-free candy and chocolate
- Sugar-free baked goods and cookies
- Some peanut butter brands (particularly "sugar-free" or "no sugar added" varieties)
- Sugar-free jelly and jam
- Toothpaste and mouthwash
- Certain medications and vitamins (liquid formulations and chewables)
- Sugar-free drink mixes
- Some nasal sprays

## Potential Toxicity in Birds

- **Hypoglycemia**: In dogs, xylitol causes a rapid, massive release of insulin leading to dangerous drops in blood sugar. A similar mechanism could theoretically affect birds, though avian-specific data is limited.
- **Liver toxicity**: Xylitol causes acute hepatic necrosis (liver cell death) in dogs. The potential for similar effects in birds has not been ruled out.
- **GI disturbance**: Sugar alcohols commonly cause gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea, bloating) even in species without specific toxic sensitivity.

## Other Artificial Sweeteners

| Sweetener | Risk to Birds | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Xylitol** | Potentially high | Known toxin in dogs; avoid in birds |
| **Aspartame** | Unknown | No avian-specific data; avoid |
| **Saccharin** | Unknown | No avian-specific data; avoid |
| **Sucralose (Splenda)** | Unknown | No avian-specific data; avoid |
| **Stevia** | Likely low | Plant-derived; limited data in birds |
| **Erythritol** | Unknown | Another sugar alcohol; avoid |

Given the lack of avian-specific research, **all artificial sweeteners should be avoided** in companion bird diets.

## Clinical Signs (If Ingested)

Potential signs based on cross-species toxicity data:
- Weakness and lethargy
- Incoordination (ataxia)
- Tremors or seizures (from hypoglycemia)
- Vomiting or regurgitation
- Diarrhea
- Collapse

## Prevention

- Never offer sugar-free products to birds.
- **Check peanut butter labels** before offering to birds -- some "natural" or "sugar-free" brands contain xylitol. Choose peanut butter with only peanuts (and optionally salt) as ingredients.
- Keep sugar-free gum, candy, and baked goods away from birds during out-of-cage time.
- Do not use human toothpaste or mouthwash near birds.
- When in doubt about any processed food ingredient, do not offer it to your bird.

## Treatment

- If xylitol ingestion is suspected, seek emergency veterinary care immediately.
- Treatment would be supportive, potentially including dextrose (glucose) supplementation for hypoglycemia and liver supportive care.
- Blood glucose monitoring would be essential.
