# Avocado Toxicity

## Overview

Avocado is one of the most dangerous foods for companion birds. All parts of the avocado plant -- fruit flesh, skin, pit, leaves, and bark -- contain **persin**, a fungicidal toxin that is highly toxic to birds. Avocado toxicosis can cause rapid cardiac failure and death in parrots, often within 12-48 hours of ingestion. There is no antidote for persin poisoning, making prevention absolutely critical.

## Toxic Compound

- **Persin** (a fatty acid derivative): Found in all parts of the avocado plant, with highest concentrations in the leaves, skin, and pit. The flesh contains lower but still toxic levels.
- The exact lethal dose for birds has not been precisely established, but even small amounts of avocado can be fatal.
- All avocado varieties (Hass, Fuerte, etc.) are considered toxic to birds.

## Mechanism of Toxicity

- Persin causes **myocardial necrosis** (death of heart muscle cells) in birds.
- It also damages mammary gland epithelium in mammals, but the cardiac toxicity is the primary concern in avian species.
- The toxin disrupts the function of cardiac myocytes, leading to arrhythmias, heart failure, and death.

## Clinical Signs

Signs of avocado toxicosis typically appear within **15 minutes to 12 hours** after ingestion:
- Weakness and lethargy
- Fluffed feathers, huddled posture
- Difficulty breathing, increased respiratory rate
- Reluctance to perch
- Anorexia (loss of appetite)
- Subcutaneous edema (fluid accumulation under the skin, particularly around the neck and chest)
- Cardiac arrhythmia
- Cyanosis (blue discoloration of skin/mucous membranes)
- Sudden death (can occur without preceding obvious signs)

## Species Affected

All bird species are considered susceptible. Documented avocado toxicosis has been reported in:
- Budgerigars
- Cockatiels
- Canaries
- Parrots of various species
- Ostriches, chickens, and other poultry
- Smaller birds may be more rapidly affected due to their small body mass.

## Treatment

- **There is no specific antidote** for persin toxicity.
- If ingestion is witnessed or suspected, **seek emergency veterinary care immediately**.
- Treatment is supportive and may include:
  - Crop lavage (washing out the crop) if ingestion was recent
  - Activated charcoal administration
  - Intravenous fluids
  - Cardiac supportive care
  - Oxygen supplementation
- Prognosis is **guarded to poor** once clinical signs develop. Early intervention improves survival chances but cardiac damage may be irreversible.

## Prevention

- **Never feed any part of avocado** to birds -- including guacamole, avocado-containing dips, or foods prepared with avocado.
- Keep avocados stored where birds cannot access them during out-of-cage time.
- Educate all family members and visitors about the danger.
- If avocado trees are accessible in outdoor aviaries, ensure birds cannot reach any part of the plant.
- Be cautious with avocado oil in skincare or cooking products used near birds.
