# Calcium & Phosphorus

## Overview

Calcium is the most abundant mineral in a bird's body and is essential for bone formation, egg shell production, nerve function, muscle contraction, blood clotting, and cardiac function. Calcium metabolism in birds is closely linked to phosphorus levels and vitamin D3 availability, and all three must be in proper balance for optimal health. Calcium deficiency is one of the most common and clinically significant nutritional disorders in companion parrots, particularly in seed-fed birds and egg-laying females.

## Functions of Calcium

- **Skeletal integrity**: Calcium constitutes the majority of bone mineral content. Adequate calcium is essential for strong, healthy bones and beak.
- **Egg shell formation**: Breeding females require massive amounts of calcium to produce properly calcified egg shells. A single egg shell can require 1-2 grams of calcium.
- **Neuromuscular function**: Calcium is critical for normal nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. Hypocalcemia causes muscle tremors, weakness, and seizures.
- **Blood clotting**: Required for the coagulation cascade.
- **Cardiac function**: Calcium is essential for normal heart rhythm and contractility.

## Calcium-to-Phosphorus Ratio

The ratio of calcium to phosphorus in the diet is as important as the absolute amount of each mineral:
- **Ideal ratio**: Approximately **1.5:1 to 2:1** (calcium to phosphorus).
- **Seed diets**: Typically provide a ratio of **1:2 to 1:7** (inverted and severely imbalanced), with excess phosphorus and inadequate calcium.
- Excess phosphorus binds calcium in the intestine, preventing its absorption and worsening deficiency even if some calcium is present in the diet.

## Signs of Calcium Deficiency

### In Adult Birds
- **Hypocalcemic seizures**: Tremors, twitching, incoordination, and seizures. Common emergency presentation, especially in African Grey Parrots.
- **Weakness and lethargy**
- **Poor feather quality**
- **Soft or deformed beak**

### In Breeding Females
- **Egg binding**: Inability to pass an egg due to insufficient calcium for muscle contraction and shell formation.
- **Thin-shelled or soft-shelled eggs**
- **Chronic egg-laying complications**
- **Reproductive prolapse**

### In Young Birds
- **Metabolic bone disease (rickets)**: Soft, bowed, or fractured bones.
- **Growth retardation**
- **Leg deformities**

## Species Most Affected

- **African Grey Parrots**: Particularly susceptible to hypocalcemia. Can present with seizures even on seemingly adequate diets due to species-specific calcium metabolism.
- **All seed-fed parrots**: Seeds are inherently low in calcium.
- **Egg-laying females**: Regardless of species, any female actively producing eggs has dramatically increased calcium requirements.

## Dietary Sources of Calcium

- **Dark leafy greens**: Kale, collard greens, bok choy, broccoli, dandelion greens (excellent sources).
- **Cuttlebone**: A classic calcium supplement that also provides enrichment through beak conditioning.
- **Mineral blocks**: Provide calcium and other trace minerals.
- **Calcium-fortified pellets**: Quality pellets contain appropriate calcium levels.
- **Cooked egg shells**: Washed, baked (to sterilize), and crushed egg shells can be sprinkled over food.
- **Almonds**: Contain moderate calcium (also high in fat, so offer sparingly).

### Foods to Limit Due to Calcium Binding
- **Spinach**: High in oxalates, which bind calcium and reduce absorption. Offer in moderation; should not be the primary leafy green.
- **Beet greens** and **rhubarb**: Also high in oxalates.

## Supplementation

- **Cuttlebone and mineral blocks** should be available in the cage at all times.
- **Liquid calcium supplements** (calcium glubionate or calcium gluconate) may be prescribed by an avian veterinarian, particularly for African Greys or egg-laying hens.
- **Calcium powder** can be sprinkled on fresh foods under veterinary guidance.
- **UVB light** is essential for vitamin D3 synthesis, which is required for calcium absorption.
- Over-supplementation can cause hypercalcemia (kidney damage, gout, soft tissue mineralization), so always follow veterinary dosing recommendations.
