# Vitamin D3

## Overview

Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is essential for calcium and phosphorus metabolism in companion parrots. Unlike mammals, birds cannot efficiently use vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and require vitamin D3 specifically. Birds synthesize vitamin D3 in their skin when exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from sunlight, but indoor-housed birds with limited natural light exposure are at significant risk of deficiency. Vitamin D3 deficiency directly impairs calcium absorption, leading to a cascade of skeletal and metabolic problems.

## Functions

- **Calcium absorption**: Vitamin D3 is required for the intestinal absorption of calcium from food. Without adequate D3, dietary calcium cannot be properly utilized regardless of how much calcium is consumed.
- **Phosphorus regulation**: Works alongside calcium to maintain proper calcium-to-phosphorus ratios essential for bone health.
- **Bone mineralization**: Ensures proper deposition of calcium into bones, beak, and egg shells.
- **Immune modulation**: Supports immune function and inflammatory response regulation.
- **Egg formation**: Critical for breeding females to produce properly calcified egg shells.

## Signs of Deficiency

- **Metabolic bone disease**: Soft, weak, or deformed bones (rickets in young birds, osteomalacia in adults).
- **Pathological fractures**: Bones that break under normal stress.
- **Beak and nail softening**: The beak may become soft, rubbery, or overgrown.
- **Egg binding**: Hens unable to produce properly calcified egg shells or to expel eggs normally.
- **Thin-shelled or soft-shelled eggs**: In breeding birds.
- **Seizures**: Severe hypocalcemia from D3/calcium deficiency can cause muscle tremors and seizures.
- **Poor growth**: In chicks and juvenile birds.

## UVB Light and Vitamin D3 Synthesis

- Birds naturally synthesize vitamin D3 through a unique pathway involving the **uropygial (preen) gland**. The gland secretes a precursor compound onto the feathers; when exposed to UVB radiation, this precursor is converted to vitamin D3, which is then ingested during preening.
- **Window glass blocks UVB rays**, so birds housed indoors near windows do NOT receive UVB exposure.
- Recommendations for indoor birds:
  - Provide a **full-spectrum UVB light** (specifically designed for birds or reptiles) positioned 30-45 cm (12-18 inches) from the bird's perching area.
  - UVB bulbs should be on for **4-8 hours daily** during daytime.
  - Replace UVB bulbs every **6-12 months**, as UV output declines with use even if visible light remains unchanged.
  - **Direct outdoor sunlight** (not filtered through glass) for 20-30 minutes several times per week is ideal when weather and safety permit.

## Dietary Sources

- **Formulated pellets**: Quality bird pellets contain supplemental vitamin D3 at appropriate levels.
- **Egg yolk** (hard-boiled): A natural source of vitamin D3, suitable as an occasional supplement.
- **Cod liver oil**: Very concentrated source; should only be used under veterinary guidance due to risk of oversupplementation.
- **UVB-exposed foods**: Fresh vegetables exposed to sunlight may contain small amounts.

## Supplementation Considerations

- Vitamin D3 is a **fat-soluble vitamin**, meaning it is stored in the body and can accumulate to toxic levels (hypervitaminosis D).
- **Toxicity** causes hypercalcemia (excess calcium in the blood), leading to mineralization of soft tissues (kidneys, blood vessels, heart), organ failure, and potentially death.
- Supplementation should only be done under veterinary supervision with appropriate dosing.
- Providing UVB light exposure is the safest way to ensure adequate vitamin D3 levels, as the bird's body naturally regulates synthesis.

## Calcium-D3 Interaction

Vitamin D3, calcium, and phosphorus work as an interconnected system:
- Without D3, calcium cannot be absorbed even if dietary calcium is adequate.
- Excess phosphorus (common in seed diets) further impairs calcium utilization.
- The ideal dietary calcium-to-phosphorus ratio for most parrots is approximately **2:1**.
