# Mineral Supplements (Cuttlebone, Mineral Blocks)

## Overview

Mineral supplements provide essential minerals that may be lacking in a companion parrot's diet, particularly calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and trace minerals such as zinc, manganese, and iron. The most common forms of mineral supplementation for companion birds are cuttlebone and mineral blocks, both of which serve the dual purpose of providing minerals and helping maintain beak health through natural abrasion.

## Cuttlebone

### What It Is
Cuttlebone is the internal shell of the cuttlefish (*Sepia* spp.), a marine cephalopod. It is composed primarily of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) with a porous, layered structure that makes it easy for birds to scrape and consume.

### Nutritional Content
- **Calcium carbonate**: The primary component, providing a readily accessible source of calcium.
- **Trace minerals**: Contains small amounts of sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc, iron, and other minerals.
- **Calcium-to-phosphorus ratio**: Favorable for birds, supporting calcium absorption.

### Benefits
- Provides supplemental calcium, particularly important for egg-laying females and growing birds.
- The soft, scraping texture helps maintain proper beak length and condition.
- Offers behavioral enrichment -- many birds enjoy scraping and chewing cuttlebone.
- Inexpensive and widely available.

### How to Offer
- Attach cuttlebone to the cage bars using the included clip or a wire holder, with the softer side facing inward for easy access.
- Replace when consumed or when it becomes soiled.
- Can be crushed and sprinkled over food for birds that do not voluntarily consume cuttlebone from a holder.

## Mineral Blocks

### What They Are
Mineral blocks (sometimes called mineral chews or conditioning perches) are commercially manufactured compressed blocks containing a mixture of minerals, calcium sources, and sometimes charcoal or oyster shell.

### Typical Composition
- Calcium carbonate (from limestone, oyster shell, or bone meal)
- Salt (sodium chloride) -- in controlled amounts
- Charcoal (in some formulations) -- intended to adsorb toxins, though veterinary evidence for this benefit is limited
- Trace minerals: iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine
- Grit or gravel (in some formulations)

### Benefits
- Provides a broader spectrum of minerals than cuttlebone alone.
- Beak conditioning and enrichment through chewing and scraping.
- Some birds prefer mineral blocks over cuttlebone, or vice versa -- offering both allows the bird to self-select.

### Considerations
- Some mineral blocks contain artificial colors or flavors. Choose natural, unflavored options when possible.
- Monitor consumption -- excessive mineral block intake (uncommon) could theoretically lead to mineral imbalances.

## Grit: The Debate

- **Grit** consists of small stones or crusite particles that some bird species use in the gizzard to grind food.
- **Psittacines (parrots) do NOT require grit**. Parrots hull their seeds before swallowing and their muscular gizzard can process food without the aid of grit.
- Excessive grit consumption can cause crop impaction and intestinal blockage, which is a medical emergency.
- Most avian veterinarians recommend **against** offering grit to parrots.
- **Mineralized grit** (containing calcium and other minerals) is occasionally offered in small amounts to some finch and canary species but is still controversial.

## Other Mineral Supplement Options

### Oyster Shell
- Crushed oyster shell provides calcium in a form similar to cuttlebone.
- Can be offered in a small dish or mixed with other supplements.
- Commonly used in aviculture for breeding birds.

### Calcium Supplements
- Liquid calcium (calcium glubionate, calcium gluconate) for oral administration under veterinary direction.
- Calcium powder (calcium carbonate or calcium lactate) to sprinkle on fresh foods.
- Particularly important for African Grey Parrots and actively egg-laying females.

### Clay Licks
- In the wild, many parrot species visit natural clay licks (mineral-rich clay deposits) to consume clay that is thought to bind plant toxins and provide supplemental minerals.
- Commercially available "bird clay" products attempt to replicate this behavior.
- While interesting as enrichment, the necessity of clay supplementation in captive birds on balanced diets is not established.

## When Supplementation Is Most Important

- **Breeding females**: Dramatically increased calcium demand for egg shell formation.
- **Growing chicks and juveniles**: Rapidly developing skeletal system requires adequate mineral intake.
- **Birds on seed-based diets**: Seeds are deficient in calcium and many trace minerals.
- **African Grey Parrots**: Species-specific susceptibility to hypocalcemia.
