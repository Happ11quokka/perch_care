# Vitamin A

## Overview

Vitamin A is arguably the most critical vitamin in companion bird nutrition and its deficiency (hypovitaminosis A) is the single most common nutritional disorder seen in pet parrots. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy epithelial tissues (skin, mucous membranes, respiratory lining), immune function, vision, reproductive health, and feather quality. Birds fed seed-only diets are almost universally deficient in vitamin A, as seeds contain little to no beta-carotene or preformed vitamin A.

## Functions

- **Epithelial tissue health**: Maintains the integrity of mucous membranes lining the mouth (choana), sinuses, respiratory tract, crop, and kidneys.
- **Immune function**: Critical for proper immune response. Deficient birds are significantly more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections.
- **Vision**: Essential for normal eye function and visual acuity.
- **Reproduction**: Required for normal egg production, fertility, and embryonic development.
- **Feather quality**: Supports healthy feather pigmentation and structure.

## Signs of Deficiency

Hypovitaminosis A is characterized by changes to epithelial tissues throughout the body:
- **Blunted choanal papillae**: The small, sharp projections along the choanal slit (roof of the mouth) become blunted, rounded, or absent. This is one of the earliest and most reliable clinical indicators.
- **White oral plaques**: Squamous metaplasia produces white, raised plaques in the mouth and throat.
- **Chronic respiratory infections**: The respiratory lining loses its normal mucus-producing cells, making it vulnerable to bacterial and fungal invasion.
- **Chronic sinusitis**: Periorbital swelling and nasal discharge.
- **Poor feather quality**: Dull, rough feathers; abnormal coloration.
- **Kidney disease**: Vitamin A deficiency can lead to visceral gout and kidney damage.
- **Reproductive failure**: Infertility, egg binding, and poor hatch rates.

## Species Most Affected

All seed-fed parrots are at risk. Species most commonly presenting with vitamin A deficiency include:
- Amazon parrots
- African Grey parrots
- Budgerigars
- Cockatiels
- Eclectus parrots

## Dietary Sources

### Beta-Carotene Rich Foods (Safest Source)
Beta-carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body as needed, making toxicity from food sources extremely rare.
- **Sweet potato** (cooked) -- one of the richest sources
- **Carrots** (raw or cooked)
- **Red and orange bell peppers**
- **Dark leafy greens** (kale, collard greens, dandelion greens, Swiss chard)
- **Butternut squash** and **pumpkin** (cooked)
- **Broccoli**
- **Mango** and **papaya**
- **Cantaloupe**

### Formulated Pellets
Quality pelleted diets contain appropriate levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene, making deficiency unlikely in birds eating a pellet-based diet.

## Supplementation

- **Dietary correction is preferred** over synthetic supplements. Converting to a pellet-based diet with daily fresh vegetables is the safest long-term solution.
- **Oral vitamin A supplementation** may be prescribed by an avian veterinarian for birds with confirmed deficiency.
- **Injectable vitamin A** is used in acute or severe cases under veterinary supervision.
- **Caution**: Excessive vitamin A supplementation (hypervitaminosis A) is toxic and can cause bone abnormalities, liver damage, and skin lesions. Supplementation should only be done under veterinary guidance.
- **Avoid adding liquid vitamins to water** -- dosing is inconsistent, promotes bacterial growth, and may alter water taste.
