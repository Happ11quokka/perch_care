# Iodine

## Overview

Iodine is an essential trace mineral required for the production of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolic rate, growth, development, and feather condition in birds. Iodine deficiency is one of the most commonly recognized nutritional disorders in budgerigars (and to a lesser extent other small parrots) fed exclusively on seed-based diets, as seeds are naturally very low in iodine. The primary clinical manifestation of iodine deficiency is thyroid hyperplasia (goiter), which can cause respiratory distress and regurgitation.

## Functions

- **Thyroid hormone production**: Iodine is a key component of the thyroid hormones T3 (triiodothyronine) and T4 (thyroxine), which are produced by the thyroid glands located on either side of the trachea.
- **Metabolic regulation**: Thyroid hormones control basal metabolic rate, affecting energy expenditure, body temperature, and organ function.
- **Growth and development**: Essential for normal growth, particularly in young birds.
- **Feather quality**: Thyroid hormones influence molt cycles and feather condition.
- **Reproductive function**: Adequate thyroid function is required for normal reproductive cycling.

## Iodine Deficiency (Goiter)

### Pathophysiology
When dietary iodine is insufficient, the thyroid glands cannot produce adequate hormones. In response, the pituitary gland releases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which causes the thyroid glands to enlarge (hyperplasia) in an attempt to increase hormone production. The enlarged thyroid glands can compress the trachea, esophagus, and crop.

### Clinical Signs
- **Regurgitation or vomiting**: Enlarged thyroid compresses the crop and esophagus.
- **Respiratory difficulty**: Wheezing, clicking sounds, labored breathing, and tail bobbing due to tracheal compression.
- **Voice change**: Altered vocalization or loss of voice.
- **Crop stasis**: Slow crop emptying due to external compression.
- **Weight loss**: From reduced food intake and metabolic disruption.
- **Lethargy and depression**
- **Poor feather condition**: Abnormal molting patterns.

### Species Most Affected
- **Budgerigars**: By far the most commonly affected species, due to their prevalence as pets and the frequency of seed-only feeding.
- **Cockatiels**: Also susceptible when fed seed-only diets.
- **Other small parrots**: Lovebirds, parrotlets, and canaries can also be affected.

## Dietary Sources of Iodine

- **Formulated pellets**: Quality pellets contain appropriate iodine supplementation, making deficiency essentially impossible in pellet-fed birds.
- **Iodine-rich vegetables**: Broccoli, kale (in moderation -- brassicas also contain goitrogens that can interfere with thyroid function if consumed excessively), seaweed (kelp).
- **Iodine bells/mineral blocks**: Commercially available iodine-supplemented mineral blocks designed for birds. These are a traditional preventive measure for seed-fed budgerigars.
- **Cuttlebone**: May contain trace amounts of iodine.
- **Egg yolk**: Contains moderate iodine levels.

## Goitrogenic Foods

Certain foods contain goitrogens -- substances that interfere with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland. These should be fed in moderation (not eliminated) alongside adequate iodine intake:
- **Brassica family**: Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, Brussels sprouts
- **Soy products**

Cooking reduces goitrogen content significantly. When iodine intake is adequate, moderate consumption of these otherwise nutritious foods is not a concern.

## Treatment

- **Dietary correction**: Transition to a pellet-based diet with fresh foods.
- **Iodine supplementation**: Lugol's iodine solution or sodium iodide may be added to the water under veterinary direction for acute treatment.
- **Veterinary care**: Severely affected birds with respiratory distress require veterinary evaluation and may need supportive care.
- **Prognosis**: Excellent with dietary correction. Thyroid glands typically return to normal size within weeks of adequate iodine intake.
