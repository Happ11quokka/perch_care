# Vitamin E

## Overview

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble antioxidant vitamin that plays a critical role in protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage, supporting immune function, and maintaining reproductive health in companion parrots. While vitamin E deficiency is less commonly diagnosed than vitamin A or D3 deficiencies, it can occur in birds fed rancid or improperly stored food, and has significant consequences for neurological and muscular function.

## Functions

- **Antioxidant protection**: Vitamin E (primarily as alpha-tocopherol) is the primary fat-soluble antioxidant in cell membranes, protecting lipids from peroxidation caused by free radicals.
- **Immune function**: Supports both cellular and humoral immune responses. Deficiency impairs the bird's ability to fight infections.
- **Reproductive health**: Essential for fertility in both males and females. Deficiency can cause embryonic death, poor hatch rates, and infertility.
- **Neurological and muscular function**: Protects nerve and muscle cell membranes. Deficiency leads to encephalomalacia (brain softening) and muscular dystrophy.
- **Skin and feather health**: Contributes to healthy skin integrity and feather condition.

## Signs of Deficiency

- **Encephalomalacia**: Softening of brain tissue causing ataxia (loss of coordination), head tilt, torticollis, and neurological signs. Seen primarily in young birds.
- **White muscle disease (nutritional muscular dystrophy)**: Degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscle, causing weakness, inability to perch, and potentially heart failure.
- **Poor reproductive performance**: Infertility, embryonic death, and reduced hatch rates.
- **Immune suppression**: Increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.
- **Exudative diathesis**: Fluid accumulation under the skin due to vascular damage (more common in poultry but can occur in psittacines).

## Causes of Deficiency

- **Rancid food**: Oxidized fats in old or improperly stored seeds and pellets destroy vitamin E. This is one of the most common causes.
- **High polyunsaturated fat diets**: Diets high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (such as sunflower seeds) increase the body's vitamin E requirement, as more antioxidant protection is needed.
- **Poor storage**: Bird food exposed to heat, light, or air oxidizes rapidly, depleting vitamin E content.
- **Malabsorption**: Any condition affecting fat absorption (liver disease, intestinal disease) can impair vitamin E uptake.

## Dietary Sources

- **Formulated pellets**: Quality pellets contain appropriate vitamin E supplementation.
- **Nuts**: Almonds, sunflower seeds (in moderation due to fat content), and hazelnuts.
- **Leafy greens**: Spinach, Swiss chard, and turnip greens.
- **Wheat germ**: One of the richest natural sources of vitamin E.
- **Red palm oil**: Rich in tocotrienols (vitamin E family); can be offered in small amounts.
- **Sprouted seeds**: Sprouting increases vitamin E availability compared to dry seeds.

## Vitamin E and Selenium Interaction

- Vitamin E and the trace mineral selenium work synergistically as antioxidants.
- Selenium is a component of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that complements vitamin E's antioxidant function.
- Deficiency of either nutrient can exacerbate the effects of the other's deficiency.
- Combined vitamin E and selenium deficiency is particularly damaging to muscle and nerve tissue.

## Supplementation

- Supplementation is generally unnecessary for birds fed a balanced pelleted diet with fresh foods.
- Birds on seed-heavy diets or those consuming rancid food may benefit from supplementation under veterinary guidance.
- Vitamin E is relatively safe even at moderate supplemental levels, with a wider margin of safety than vitamins A or D3.
- Wheat germ oil or vitamin E capsules can be added to food under veterinary direction.

## Storage and Prevention

- **Store bird food** in airtight containers in cool, dry, dark locations.
- **Check expiration dates** and discard food that is old, has an off smell, or appears rancid.
- **Use food within 6-8 weeks** of opening the package.
- **Refrigeration** can extend shelf life and slow oxidation.
