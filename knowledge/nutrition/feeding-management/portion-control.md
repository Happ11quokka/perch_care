# Portion Control & Feeding Schedules

## Overview

Proper portion control is essential for preventing obesity -- one of the most common health problems in companion parrots. Unlike wild birds that expend significant energy flying and foraging, captive parrots are often sedentary, and unrestricted food access leads to overconsumption of calorie-dense foods. Establishing appropriate portions and feeding schedules helps maintain healthy body weight and encourages natural eating rhythms.

## General Portion Guidelines

As a rough guideline, companion parrots consume approximately **10-15% of their body weight** in food daily:

| Bird Size | Body Weight Range | Daily Food (Approximate) |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Small (budgie, lovebird) | 30-60 g | 3-8 g |
| Small-Medium (cockatiel) | 80-120 g | 8-15 g |
| Medium (conure, caique) | 60-180 g | 8-20 g |
| Medium-Large (African Grey, Amazon) | 300-600 g | 30-60 g |
| Large (macaw, cockatoo) | 300-1200 g | 30-120 g |

*These are estimates. Individual needs vary based on species, age, activity level, health status, and environmental temperature.*

## Feeding Schedule

### Two-Meal System (Recommended)
- **Morning meal**: Offer the largest meal of the day, including pellets and fresh foods. Birds are hungriest in the morning after an overnight fast.
- **Evening meal**: A smaller offering of pellets and/or fresh foods, 2-3 hours before lights-out.
- **Pellets available**: Some owners leave pellets accessible throughout the day, which is acceptable as pellets are nutritionally balanced and less likely to be overeaten compared to seeds.

### Single Meal System
- Some avian nutritionists recommend a single large meal in the morning with pellets available throughout the day.
- Fresh foods are offered at the morning meal and removed after 2-4 hours.

### Free-Feeding Considerations
- **Pellets**: Can generally be available throughout the day without significant risk of overconsumption.
- **Seeds**: Should NOT be free-fed. Birds will selectively overeat seeds, particularly sunflower and safflower.
- **Fresh foods**: Offer during designated meal times and remove after 2-4 hours for food safety.

## Weight Monitoring

- **Weigh your bird regularly** using a digital gram scale.
  - During dietary changes: Daily
  - Normal maintenance: Weekly to monthly
  - Senior birds: Monthly
- Weigh at the same time each day (first thing in the morning, before feeding, is most consistent).
- Record weights to track trends over time.
- A weight change of more than **10% from baseline** (in either direction) warrants veterinary consultation.

## Adjusting Portions

### If Bird Is Overweight
- Reduce or eliminate seeds and nuts.
- Increase vegetable proportion (low-calorie, high-fiber).
- Reduce fruit (higher in sugar).
- Encourage exercise (flight time, foraging activities).
- Transition gradually -- never drastically restrict food.

### If Bird Is Underweight
- Ensure pellets are freely available.
- Add nutrient-dense foods (cooked eggs, legumes, small amounts of nuts).
- Evaluate for underlying health issues (parasites, infection, organ disease).
- Consult an avian veterinarian.

## Common Portion Mistakes

- **Filling the bowl**: Many owners fill food bowls to the top. Birds may eat only the top layer (selecting favorites) while the rest goes to waste.
- **Seed bowl always full**: Creates a constant supply of high-fat food, encouraging overeating.
- **Too many treats**: Nuts, seeds, and human food treats add calories quickly.
- **Not accounting for training treats**: If using food rewards for training, reduce the main meal proportionally.
