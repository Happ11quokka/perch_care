# Weight Management & Obesity Prevention

## Overview

Obesity is one of the most prevalent and serious health problems in companion parrots. Studies suggest that a significant proportion of pet birds (estimates range from 40-70% depending on the species and study) are overweight or obese. Obesity directly contributes to fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis), atherosclerosis, lipomas, diabetes, reproductive problems, and significantly shortened lifespan. Effective weight management through diet, exercise, and monitoring is essential for every companion parrot's long-term health.

## Assessing Body Condition

### The Keel Bone Assessment
The primary method for assessing body condition in birds is palpation of the **keel bone** (sternum):
- **Underweight**: Keel bone is sharply prominent, with little or no muscle on either side. The bone feels like a blade.
- **Ideal weight**: Keel bone is palpable but not sharply prominent. Breast muscles are full and rounded on either side, approximately level with the keel.
- **Overweight**: Keel bone is difficult to feel, buried under fat and/or muscle. Breast area feels soft and rounded, and fat deposits may be visible as yellowish subcutaneous fat.

### Regular Weighing
- Use a **digital gram scale** accurate to 1 gram.
- Weigh at the same time each day (preferably morning, before feeding).
- Record weights to track trends.
- Normal weight varies by species:

| Species | Typical Healthy Weight |
|---------|----------------------|
| Budgerigar | 30-40 g |
| Cockatiel | 80-110 g |
| Lovebird | 42-60 g |
| Green-cheeked Conure | 60-80 g |
| Sun Conure | 100-120 g |
| Senegal Parrot | 120-170 g |
| African Grey | 400-550 g |
| Amazon Parrot | 350-500 g |
| Blue-and-Gold Macaw | 900-1200 g |
| Umbrella Cockatoo | 450-700 g |

## Species Most Prone to Obesity

- **Amazon parrots**: Extremely obesity-prone. Require strict dietary management.
- **Budgerigars**: Commonly overweight on seed diets, leading to lipomas.
- **Cockatiels**: Prone to fatty liver disease on seed-heavy diets.
- **Cockatoos**: Sedentary cage life combined with high-fat diets.
- **African Grey Parrots**: Can become overweight, especially with excessive nut consumption.

## Causes of Obesity

- **High-fat seed diets**: The primary cause. Sunflower seeds are 40-50% fat.
- **Excessive treats**: Nuts, seeds, and human food treats add significant calories.
- **Insufficient exercise**: Caged birds with limited flight opportunities burn few calories.
- **Boredom eating**: Birds with inadequate enrichment may eat out of boredom.
- **Hormonal factors**: Breeding-condition females may increase food intake.
- **Metabolic issues**: Hypothyroidism (rare but possible) can contribute.

## Health Consequences of Obesity

- **Hepatic lipidosis** (fatty liver disease): Fat infiltration of the liver leading to organ dysfunction and failure.
- **Atherosclerosis**: Cholesterol plaque in arteries, increasing risk of stroke and heart attack.
- **Lipomas**: Benign fatty tumors, especially common in budgerigars and cockatiels.
- **Xanthomas**: Yellow, cholesterol-filled skin masses.
- **Reproductive problems**: Egg binding, chronic egg-laying complications.
- **Joint stress**: Excess weight stresses joints and feet, contributing to bumblefoot.
- **Decreased lifespan**: Obese birds live significantly shorter lives than those at healthy weight.
- **Reduced quality of life**: Difficulty flying, perching, and playing.

## Weight Loss Strategy

### Dietary Changes (Gradual)
1. **Transition to pellets**: If the bird is on seeds, begin gradual conversion to a pellet-based diet (see converting-seed-to-pellets.md).
2. **Eliminate or drastically reduce seeds and nuts**: Maximum 5% of diet for obese birds.
3. **Increase vegetables**: Low-calorie, high-fiber vegetables should be the primary fresh food.
4. **Reduce fruit**: Limit due to sugar content.
5. **No human food treats**: Eliminate chips, crackers, bread, cheese, and other high-calorie human foods.
6. **Measure food portions**: Do not free-feed seeds.

### Increase Exercise
- **Flight time**: Encourage flying within a bird-safe room. Even short flights significantly increase caloric expenditure.
- **Foraging enrichment**: Makes the bird work for food, burning more calories and extending feeding time.
- **Climbing and play**: Encourage active play with ladders, ropes, and climbing structures.
- **Training sessions**: Active trick training and recall training burn calories and provide mental stimulation.

### Monitoring
- Weigh weekly during an active weight loss program.
- Target weight loss rate: approximately **1-2% of body weight per week**. Faster weight loss can be dangerous.
- If the bird loses more than 10% of body weight without veterinary guidance, consult an avian veterinarian.
- Blood work (liver values, cholesterol, triglycerides) can help monitor metabolic health during weight loss.

## Prevention

- Start young birds on a balanced pellet-based diet with fresh foods.
- Never make seeds the primary food source.
- Provide daily out-of-cage exercise and foraging opportunities.
- Monitor weight regularly throughout life.
- Educate all family members about appropriate treats and feeding.
