# Foraging as Feeding Enrichment

## Overview

In the wild, parrots spend 4-8 hours per day foraging for food -- searching, selecting, manipulating, and consuming a wide variety of food items. In captivity, food is typically presented in an easily accessible bowl, reducing the feeding process to minutes. This dramatic reduction in foraging time contributes to boredom, behavioral problems (feather plucking, screaming, stereotypic behaviors), and obesity. Incorporating foraging opportunities into a bird's daily feeding routine is one of the most impactful enrichment strategies available.

## Why Foraging Matters

- **Occupies time**: Extends feeding activity from minutes to hours, mimicking natural time budgets.
- **Mental stimulation**: Problem-solving to access food engages cognitive function.
- **Reduces behavioral problems**: Birds that forage show significantly lower rates of feather destructive behavior, screaming, and stereotypic movements.
- **Slows food consumption**: Prevents rapid overconsumption, aiding weight management.
- **Encourages natural behavior**: Foraging is an innate behavior that provides psychological satisfaction.
- **Increases food variety acceptance**: Birds may try new foods when presented in a foraging context.

## Foraging Methods

### Level 1: Beginner (Visible Food, Easy Access)
For birds new to foraging, start simple:
- Place food in multiple locations around the cage instead of one bowl.
- Scatter pellets on a flat tray or paper towel.
- Weave leafy greens through cage bars.
- Skewer vegetables and fruits on stainless steel kabob holders.
- Place food in shallow dishes on different perches.

### Level 2: Intermediate (Partially Hidden)
- Cover food dishes with a paper towel or thin piece of paper the bird must move.
- Place food in small paper cups or cupcake liners inside the food dish.
- Wrap treats in small pieces of paper.
- Use a foraging tray filled with shredded paper, wooden beads, or craft sticks with food mixed in.
- Offer food in a wiffle ball or other object with holes.

### Level 3: Advanced (Hidden, Requires Problem-Solving)
- Use commercial foraging toys that require lifting lids, pulling drawers, unscrewing caps, or turning wheels.
- Wrap food in multiple layers of paper or inside a small cardboard box.
- Place food inside clean, bird-safe containers with small openings.
- Create foraging "puzzles" using stacked cups, paper bags, or woven baskets.
- Use acrylic foraging devices designed for parrots.

## DIY Foraging Ideas

- **Paper towel roll**: Fold ends, fill with treats.
- **Muffin tin foraging**: Place food in a muffin tin and cover some cups with paper or small balls.
- **Paper bag lunch**: Place food in a small paper bag and fold it shut.
- **Cardboard box**: Cut small holes in a cardboard box, place food inside.
- **Popsicle stick lattice**: Create a grid over a food dish with craft sticks.
- **Shreddable wraps**: Wrap food in corn husks, palm leaves, or vine leaves.
- **Vegetable skewers**: Thread vegetables, fruits, and greens on a stainless steel skewer hung in the cage.

## Guidelines for Success

- **Start easy**: If your bird has never foraged, begin at Level 1 and gradually increase difficulty. Frustration from immediate high difficulty can cause stress.
- **Ensure adequate nutrition**: During the foraging learning phase, maintain one accessible food bowl alongside foraging opportunities to ensure the bird eats enough.
- **Monitor intake**: Watch for signs that the bird is not consuming enough food (weight loss, lethargy).
- **Use preferred foods first**: Start foraging with the bird's favorite foods to motivate exploration.
- **Rotate foraging methods**: Change foraging setups regularly to maintain novelty and interest.
- **Safety**: All foraging materials must be bird-safe (no toxic inks, adhesives, or small parts that could be swallowed).

## Species Considerations

- **Cockatoos and African Greys**: Benefit enormously from foraging; these intelligent species are most prone to behavioral problems from boredom.
- **Macaws**: Natural ground foragers; offer floor-level foraging trays.
- **Budgerigars and cockatiels**: Enjoy scatter foraging and simple toys.
- **Lorikeets**: Foraging with flowers and nectar-soaked items mimics their natural feeding behavior.
