# Food Storage & Freshness

## Overview

Proper storage of bird food is essential for maintaining nutritional quality and preventing contamination. Bird food that is improperly stored can lose vitamin content, become rancid, or develop mold and bacterial growth -- all of which can cause illness in companion parrots. Understanding storage best practices for different food types ensures that birds receive safe, nutritious food every day.

## Pellet Storage

- **Airtight container**: Transfer pellets from the original bag to an airtight container immediately after opening to prevent moisture absorption and oxidation.
- **Cool, dry location**: Store at room temperature in a dry area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.
- **Use within 6-8 weeks** of opening. Vitamins (particularly fat-soluble vitamins A and E) degrade over time, even in sealed containers.
- **Check expiration dates**: Do not purchase or use pellets past their expiration date.
- **Refrigeration**: Can extend freshness but is not required if the container is airtight and the storage area is cool.
- **Freezing**: Pellets can be frozen for long-term storage (up to 6 months). Thaw portions at room temperature as needed.
- **Inspect regularly**: Discard pellets that show signs of moisture, clumping, mold, off-odor, or insect infestation.

## Seed Storage

- **Airtight container**: Critical for preventing moisture and insect contamination.
- **Cool, dry, dark location**: Heat and light accelerate fat oxidation (rancidity) in seeds.
- **Use within 4-6 weeks** of opening for optimal freshness. Seeds are high in fats that become rancid with time and exposure to air.
- **Smell test**: Fresh seeds have a mild, pleasant smell. Rancid seeds smell musty or sharp. Discard any seeds with an off-odor.
- **Insect prevention**: Seed moths and weevils are common in stored seed mixes. Freezing seed bags for 48 hours before opening kills insect eggs and larvae.
- **Inspect for mold**: Any signs of mold (discoloration, fuzzy growth, musty smell) mean the entire batch should be discarded. Mold (particularly *Aspergillus*) in bird food is a direct cause of aspergillosis in birds.

## Fresh Food Storage

### Fruits and Vegetables
- Store in the refrigerator crisper drawer.
- Wash just before serving (washing and then storing promotes faster spoilage).
- Most fresh produce maintains quality for 3-7 days when properly refrigerated.
- Cut or chopped fresh food should be used within 24-48 hours.

### Prepared "Chop" or Mash
- Refrigerate daily portions for up to 3-4 days.
- Freeze larger batches in individual daily portions for up to 2-3 months.
- Thaw in the refrigerator overnight (not at room temperature, which promotes bacterial growth).
- Never refreeze thawed portions.

### Cooked Foods
- Cooked eggs, grains, legumes, and pasta should be refrigerated and used within 2-3 days.
- Can be frozen for longer storage (up to 1-2 months).

## Signs of Spoiled Food

| Food Type | Signs of Spoilage |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Pellets | Musty smell, visible mold, moisture/clumping, insect activity |
| Seeds | Rancid smell, mold, insect webbing or larvae, dust |
| Fresh produce | Wilting, slime, discoloration, mold, off-odor |
| Cooked food | Sour smell, mold, unusual texture, discoloration |
| Nectar (lorikeet) | Cloudiness, fermented smell, film on surface |

## Mold and Aspergillosis Risk

- **Aspergillus** mold is ubiquitous in the environment and thrives on improperly stored grains, seeds, and nuts.
- Birds that inhale or ingest *Aspergillus* spores can develop aspergillosis, a serious and potentially fatal fungal infection.
- **Prevention**: Proper storage in airtight containers, regular freshness checks, discarding any food with visible mold, and purchasing from reputable suppliers.
- Peanuts and corn are particularly susceptible to *Aspergillus* contamination and aflatoxin production. Only purchase human-grade, properly stored peanuts for birds.

## Water Dish Hygiene

- Change water at least twice daily.
- Wash water dishes with hot water and mild soap daily.
- Disinfect weekly with a diluted avian-safe disinfectant or vinegar solution.
- Replace cracked or scratched dishes that harbor bacteria.
