# Cooking for Birds (Birdie Bread, Mash)

## Overview

Preparing cooked food for companion parrots is an excellent way to provide nutrition, variety, and enrichment. Cooked food items like "birdie bread," vegetable mash, and grain mixtures allow owners to incorporate a wide range of healthy ingredients that birds might otherwise reject in raw form. Cooking also softens hard vegetables and grains, making nutrients more accessible and food more palatable for birds of all sizes.

## Birdie Bread

Birdie bread is a baked mixture of cornbread or muffin batter with added bird-healthy ingredients. It is one of the most popular homemade bird foods.

### Basic Recipe
- 1 box unsweetened cornbread or corn muffin mix (check that ingredients are bird-safe; avoid those with excessive sugar)
- 2 eggs (with shells -- wash shells, crush, and add for calcium)
- Required liquid per box instructions (substitute vegetable juice or water for milk)
- **Add-ins** (choose several):
  - Finely chopped vegetables: carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, peas, corn, sweet potato
  - Pellets (crushed) -- helps transition birds to pellets
  - Cooked beans or lentils
  - Sprouted seeds
  - Dried herbs (oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme)
  - Small amount of unsweetened applesauce
  - Flaxseed meal or chia seeds (omega-3 source)
  - Chopped dark leafy greens

### Preparation
1. Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F).
2. Mix cornbread batter according to package directions.
3. Fold in chosen add-ins.
4. Pour into a greased muffin tin or baking dish.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden and a toothpick comes out clean.

## Cooking Guidelines

### Do
- Use plain water for cooking (no salt, oil, butter, or seasonings).
- Cook legumes thoroughly (raw/undercooked beans contain toxic lectins).
- Cook eggs thoroughly (raw egg white contains avidin, which binds biotin).
- Cool all food to room temperature before serving.
- Prepare in batches and freeze individual portions for convenience.
- Use bird-safe ingredients only.

### Do NOT
- Add salt, sugar, oil, butter, or any seasoning.
- Use non-stick cookware for cooking bird food (PTFE/Teflon fumes are fatal to birds -- see toxicology section).
- Serve food hot (causes crop burns).
- Leave cooked food in the cage for more than 2-4 hours.
- Use processed ingredients (canned vegetables with sodium, pre-seasoned rice mixes).

## Benefits of Cooking for Birds
