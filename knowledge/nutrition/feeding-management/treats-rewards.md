# Healthy Treats & Training Rewards

## Overview

Treats play an important role in companion parrot care -- they strengthen the bond between bird and owner, serve as positive reinforcement during training, and provide dietary variety and enrichment. However, inappropriate treat choices are a leading cause of obesity and nutritional imbalance in pet birds. Understanding which treats are healthy and how to incorporate them responsibly ensures that treats enhance rather than undermine a bird's diet.

## Healthy Treat Options

### Nuts (High-Value Rewards)
- **Almonds**: Lower in fat than many nuts; a good all-around treat.
- **Walnuts**: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
- **Pine nuts**: Small size makes them ideal for training smaller birds.
- **Pecans, cashews, hazelnuts**: In small quantities.
- **Pistachios**: Unsalted, unshelled (shell removal provides enrichment).
- **Macadamia nuts**: Suitable for larger parrots.
- **Limit**: 1-3 nuts per day for large parrots; 1 small nut or nut piece for small parrots. Nuts are calorie-dense (40-70% fat).
- **Always unsalted and unflavored**.

### Seeds (Moderate-Value Rewards)
- **Spray millet**: The classic training treat for small to medium parrots. Can be broken into small clusters.
- **Sunflower seeds**: High-value but high-fat. Use sparingly (1-3 per training session).
- **Safflower seeds**: Slightly lower in fat than sunflower.
- **Pumpkin seeds**: Nutritious; can be raw or unsalted roasted.

### Fresh Food Treats
- **Berries**: Blueberries, strawberry pieces, raspberries -- naturally sweet, nutrient-rich, relatively low calorie.
- **Grape halves**: Popular with many species.
- **Small fruit pieces**: Apple, mango, papaya, melon.
- **Peas and corn**: Thawed frozen peas and corn kernels are easy, convenient treats.
- **Pepper pieces**: Many parrots love hot peppers.
- **Pomegranate seeds**: Nutritious and fun to eat.

### Commercially Prepared Treats
- **Lafeber Nutri-Berries**: Combine pellet nutrition with seeds and grains in a round, manipulable shape. Provide balanced nutrition while serving as a foraging treat.
- **Lafeber Avi-Cakes**: Similar concept in a different form.
- **Dried fruit (unsweetened, unsulfured)**: Dried papaya, mango, cranberry. Check labels for added sugar or sulfur dioxide preservatives.

## Training Reward Strategy

### Size
- Training rewards should be **tiny** -- just enough for one bite. The goal is a taste, not a meal.
- For a large parrot: a sliver of almond, a single sunflower seed, a pea.
- For a small parrot: a single millet seed cluster, a tiny berry piece.

### Value Hierarchy
Establish a "reward hierarchy" with different treat values for different training situations:
- **Low value** (for easy behaviors): Pellet, piece of vegetable, pea
- **Medium value** (for moderate behaviors): Millet, piece of fruit
- **High value** (for new/difficult behaviors): Nut piece, sunflower seed

### Accounting for Treat Calories
- When using treats for training, slightly **reduce the main meal** to compensate for treat calories.
- Keep a mental or written tally of treats given during a training session.
- If training extensively, use lower-calorie rewards (peas, berries, vegetables) for most repetitions, saving high-value treats for breakthrough moments.

## Treats to Avoid

- **Chocolate and caffeine**: Toxic (see chocolate-caffeine.md)
- **Salty snacks**: Chips, pretzels, salted crackers
- **Sugary foods**: Candy, cookies, sweetened cereal
- **Fried foods**: French fries, fried chicken, etc.
- **Processed human foods**: Bread (minimal nutrition), cheese (high fat/salt), deli meats
- **Honey**: Risk of *Clostridium botulinum* spores
- **Yogurt drops and "bird candy"**: Marketed to bird owners but typically high in sugar, fat, and artificial ingredients

## Social Eating as a Treat

- Sharing a healthy meal with your bird is itself a rewarding experience for social species.
- Eating together reinforces flock bonding behavior.
- Offer safe foods from your plate: plain vegetables, plain rice, plain pasta, fruit pieces.
- Never share: salty, sweet, fried, or seasoned foods; anything containing avocado, chocolate, caffeine, onion, or garlic.
