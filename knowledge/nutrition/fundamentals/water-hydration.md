# Water & Hydration

## Overview

Clean, fresh water is essential for companion bird health. Water plays a critical role in digestion, nutrient absorption, temperature regulation, waste elimination, and overall metabolic function. Dehydration in birds can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, making proper water provision one of the most fundamental aspects of daily bird care.

## Water Requirements

Birds require access to fresh, clean water at all times. General water consumption varies by species, diet, and environmental conditions:

- **Small parrots** (budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds): approximately 5-10 mL per day
- **Medium parrots** (conures, caiques, Senegals): approximately 15-30 mL per day
- **Large parrots** (African Greys, Amazons, macaws): approximately 30-60 mL per day
- **Lorikeets and lories**: Significantly higher water intake due to their liquid nectar-based diet

Birds fed primarily dry diets (pellets and seeds) will drink more water than those receiving abundant fresh fruits and vegetables, which have high water content.

## Water Quality

- **Filtered or bottled water** is recommended in areas with poor tap water quality or heavily chlorinated water.
- **Tap water** is generally acceptable if it is safe for human consumption, though allowing it to stand for a few hours or using a carbon filter can reduce chlorine levels.
- **Distilled water** is not recommended as a sole water source, as it lacks minerals that contribute to overall nutrition.
- **Avoid** water that has been softened with sodium-based water softeners, as excess sodium is harmful to birds.

## Water Dish Management

- **Change water at least twice daily** -- more frequently in warm environments or if the bird dunks food in the water.
- **Wash water dishes thoroughly** with hot water and mild soap daily. Rinse completely to remove soap residue.
- **Disinfect water dishes** weekly with a diluted avian-safe disinfectant or a vinegar-water solution (1:10 ratio), rinsing thoroughly afterward.
- Birds that dunk food in their water create a bacterial breeding ground. In such cases, water may need to be changed multiple times daily.

## Types of Water Dispensers

- **Open water dishes**: Most common and natural. Easy to clean but prone to contamination from food, droppings, and debris.
- **Water bottles (sipper tubes)**: Keep water cleaner for longer. However, not all birds will use them, the tubes can clog or malfunction, and they are harder to clean thoroughly. If used, check daily that the tube is functioning.
- **Multiple water sources**: Providing both a dish and a bottle ensures the bird always has access to water.

## Signs of Dehydration

- Dry or flaky skin around the feet and beak
- Sunken or dull eyes
- Loss of skin elasticity (skin tent test)
- Thickened or reduced droppings
- Lethargy and weakness
- Wrinkled skin on the toes

Dehydration is a medical emergency in birds. If signs of dehydration are observed, seek veterinary attention immediately.

## Special Considerations

- **Vitamins in water**: Adding liquid vitamins to water is generally discouraged by avian veterinarians, as it promotes bacterial growth, alters water taste (potentially reducing intake), and provides inconsistent dosing. Vitamins are better delivered through food or direct oral supplementation.
- **Electrolyte solutions**: May be recommended by a veterinarian for sick or dehydrated birds, but should not be used routinely without veterinary guidance.
- **Bathing water**: Bathing water is separate from drinking water. Never add soap or chemicals to bathing water.
