# Fresh Foods Guide (Fruits & Vegetables)

## Overview

Fresh fruits and vegetables are an essential component of a balanced companion parrot diet. They provide vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, phytonutrients, and dietary fiber that pellets alone cannot fully replicate. Fresh foods also offer mental stimulation through variety in color, texture, and taste, encouraging natural foraging behavior. Vegetables should make up a larger portion of the fresh food offering than fruits, as fruits are higher in sugar.

## Recommended Vegetables

Vegetables should be offered **daily** and should constitute the majority of the fresh food portion of the diet.

### Dark Leafy Greens (Excellent – Offer Daily)
- Kale
- Swiss chard
- Collard greens
- Dandelion greens
- Mustard greens
- Romaine lettuce (moderate nutritional value; avoid iceberg lettuce which has minimal nutrition)
- Bok choy
- Spinach (in moderation -- high in oxalates which can bind calcium)

### Orange/Yellow Vegetables (High in Vitamin A)
- Carrots (raw or lightly steamed)
- Sweet potato (cooked)
- Butternut squash (cooked)
- Pumpkin (cooked)
- Bell peppers (all colors, especially red and orange)

### Other Recommended Vegetables
- Broccoli and broccoli florets
- Cauliflower
- Peas (fresh or thawed frozen)
- Green beans
- Corn on the cob (fresh or thawed frozen)
- Zucchini
- Cucumber
- Beets
- Snap peas
- Brussels sprouts
- Jalapeño and chili peppers (birds lack capsaicin receptors and enjoy hot peppers)

## Recommended Fruits

Fruits should be offered in **moderation** (smaller portions than vegetables) due to their higher sugar content.

- Apples (remove seeds -- they contain amygdalin)
- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries)
- Grapes (seedless preferred)
- Banana
- Mango
- Papaya
- Melon (watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew)
- Kiwi
- Pomegranate
- Pear (remove seeds)
- Oranges and citrus (in small amounts)
- Cherries (remove pit)
- Peaches and nectarines (remove pit)
- Figs

## Preparation Guidelines

- **Wash thoroughly** to remove pesticide residues. Organic produce is preferred when possible.
- **Chop into appropriate sizes** based on bird species. Smaller birds need smaller pieces; larger birds can handle bigger chunks or whole items.
- **Raw is generally best** for most vegetables and all fruits. Light steaming can make some hard vegetables (sweet potato, squash, carrots) easier to eat and can increase availability of some nutrients.
- **Remove uneaten fresh food** after 2-4 hours to prevent bacterial growth, especially in warm environments.
- **Frozen vegetables** (thawed) are an acceptable alternative when fresh produce is unavailable. Avoid canned vegetables due to added sodium.

## Foods to Avoid

- **Avocado** -- toxic to birds (contains persin)
- **Onion, garlic, chives** -- can cause hemolytic anemia
- **Fruit seeds and pits** -- apple seeds, cherry pits, peach pits contain cyanogenic compounds
- **Iceberg lettuce** -- minimal nutritional value and can cause diarrhea
- **Raw rhubarb** -- contains oxalic acid
- **Mushrooms** -- some varieties can be toxic

## Tips for Encouraging Fresh Food Consumption

- Offer fresh foods in the morning when birds are most hungry
- Try different presentations: whole, chopped, shredded, skewered, hung from cage bars
- Eat fresh foods in front of your bird -- parrots are social eaters and may try foods they see their flock (owner) eating
- Mix new foods with familiar favorites
- Be persistent -- it may take 10-15 exposures before a bird accepts a new food
