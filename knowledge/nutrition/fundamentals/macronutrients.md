# Macronutrients (Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates)

## Overview

Macronutrients -- proteins, fats, and carbohydrates -- form the caloric foundation of a companion parrot's diet. Understanding the role and appropriate balance of these nutrients is essential for maintaining optimal bird health. The specific macronutrient requirements vary by species, life stage, and activity level, but general principles apply across most companion psittacines.

## Protein

### Role
Protein is essential for growth, feather production, muscle maintenance, immune function, enzyme production, and tissue repair. Amino acids -- the building blocks of protein -- are particularly critical during molting, growth, and breeding.

### Requirements
- Most adult companion parrots require 10-15% protein in their diet on a dry matter basis.
- Breeding and growing birds have higher requirements (15-20%).
- Molting birds also benefit from increased protein to support feather regrowth.

### Key Amino Acids
- **Lysine**: Often deficient in seed-based diets. Essential for growth and feather quality.
- **Methionine**: A sulfur-containing amino acid critical for feather keratin production. Commonly deficient in all-seed diets.
- **Arginine**: Important for immune function and wound healing.

### Sources
- Formulated pellets (balanced amino acid profile)
- Cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, beans)
- Cooked eggs (hard-boiled or scrambled without oil/salt)
- Sprouted seeds and grains
- Small amounts of cooked chicken or fish (species-dependent, consult veterinarian)

## Fat

### Role
Fats provide concentrated energy, support absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), maintain healthy skin and feather condition, and provide essential fatty acids that birds cannot synthesize.

### Requirements
- Most adult companion parrots require 4-8% fat in their diet on a dry matter basis.
- Macaws and other large parrots that consume nuts in the wild may tolerate slightly higher fat levels (8-12%).
- Overweight birds or species prone to obesity (Amazons, cockatoos, budgerigars) should be on lower-fat diets.

### Essential Fatty Acids
- **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Anti-inflammatory properties, support cardiovascular health. Found in flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts.
- **Omega-6 fatty acids**: Support skin and feather health. Found in most seeds and grains.
- The ideal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio for birds is not precisely established but should generally favor omega-3 intake over the typical seed-heavy diet.

### Risks of Excess Fat
- Obesity
- Hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease)
- Atherosclerosis
- Lipomas (fatty tumors)

## Carbohydrates

### Role
Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for daily metabolic activity. They include simple sugars, complex starches, and dietary fiber.

### Sources
- **Complex carbohydrates** (preferred): Whole grains, cooked brown rice, cooked pasta, sweet potato, squash, legumes. These provide sustained energy and dietary fiber.
- **Simple sugars**: Found naturally in fruits. Should be offered in moderation.
- **Fiber**: Important for digestive health. Found in vegetables, whole grains, and pellets.

### Considerations
- Birds do not have a strict carbohydrate requirement as they can derive energy from fats and proteins, but carbohydrates provide readily available energy for active birds.
- Excessive simple sugars (from too much fruit or sweetened foods) can promote yeast overgrowth (candidiasis) in the crop and digestive tract.

## Recommended Macronutrient Balance

| Nutrient | Adult Maintenance | Breeding/Growing | Molting |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Protein | 10-15% | 15-20% | 12-18% |
| Fat | 4-8% | 6-10% | 5-8% |
| Carbohydrates | Remainder | Remainder | Remainder |
| Fiber | 3-8% | 3-6% | 3-8% |
