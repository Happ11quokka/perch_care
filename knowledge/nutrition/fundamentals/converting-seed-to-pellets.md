# Converting from Seeds to Pellets

## Overview

Transitioning a companion parrot from a seed-based diet to a pelleted diet is one of the most important dietary changes an owner can make, but it can also be one of the most challenging. Many birds are reluctant to accept pellets, having been conditioned to prefer the taste and texture of seeds. A slow, patient, and monitored approach is essential to ensure the bird maintains adequate nutrition and body weight throughout the conversion process.

## Why Convert

- Seed-only diets are nutritionally incomplete, leading to vitamin A deficiency, calcium deficiency, obesity, and fatty liver disease.
- Pelleted diets provide balanced, complete nutrition in every bite.
- Birds on balanced diets with pellets live significantly longer and healthier lives than those on seed-only diets.

## Preparation

Before starting the conversion:
1. **Obtain a baseline weight**: Weigh your bird on a gram scale and record the weight. This is the most critical monitoring tool during conversion.
2. **Consult your avian veterinarian**: Ensure your bird is healthy enough for a dietary transition. Sick, underweight, or very young birds may need special protocols.
3. **Choose the right pellet**: Select an appropriate pellet brand and size for your bird's species. Offer several brands to see which the bird shows interest in.

## Conversion Methods

### Method 1: Gradual Mixing (Recommended for Most Birds)
1. **Week 1**: Mix 25% pellets with 75% seeds in the food dish.
2. **Week 2**: Increase to 50% pellets and 50% seeds.
3. **Week 3**: Increase to 75% pellets and 25% seeds.
4. **Week 4+**: Offer primarily pellets with seeds only as a small treat or for foraging.
- Adjust the timeline based on individual bird response. Some birds convert in days; others may take weeks or months.

### Method 2: Separate Dish Method
- Offer pellets in one dish and a reduced amount of seeds in another dish.
- Gradually reduce the seed quantity over several weeks.
- Eventually offer seeds only for brief periods (e.g., 30 minutes in the morning and evening) while pellets remain available all day.

### Method 3: Modeling and Social Eating
- Eat pellets (or pretend to) in front of your bird. Parrots are social eaters and are more likely to try foods they see their "flock" eating.
- If you have a bird that already eats pellets, house them nearby so the converting bird can observe and learn.

## Critical Monitoring

- **Weigh your bird daily** on a gram scale at the same time each day (preferably first thing in the morning before feeding).
- **If the bird loses more than 10% of its starting body weight**, consult your avian veterinarian immediately and temporarily reintroduce more seeds.
- **Monitor droppings**: Changes in droppings are normal during conversion (pellet droppings differ from seed droppings in color and consistency), but very small, dark, or absent droppings may indicate the bird is not eating enough.
- **Watch for lethargy or fluffed feathers**, which may indicate inadequate food intake.

## Tips for Success

- **Be patient**: Some birds take several weeks to months to fully convert. Rushing the process can be dangerous.
- **Try different pellet brands and flavors**: If a bird rejects one brand, try another. Some birds prefer colored/flavored pellets initially, while others prefer natural.
- **Crush pellets and sprinkle over favorite foods** to introduce the taste gradually.
- **Moisten pellets slightly** with water or fruit juice to alter the texture and make them more appealing.
- **Offer pellets first thing in the morning** when the bird is hungriest, and reserve seeds for later in the day.
- **Use pellets as treats** by hand-feeding them during positive interaction times.
- **Never starve a bird into eating pellets**. This is dangerous and can cause rapid weight loss, hepatic lipidosis, and death.

## Species-Specific Considerations

- **Budgerigars and cockatiels**: Often among the most resistant to conversion. Very small pellets and patience are key.
- **Lorikeets**: Should NOT be converted to standard pellets. Require specialized lorikeet nectar formulas.
- **Eclectus parrots**: May benefit from a diet higher in fresh foods with pellets as a supplement rather than the dietary base, due to their unique digestive physiology.
