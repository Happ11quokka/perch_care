# Pellet Diet Basics

## Overview

Formulated pelleted diets are widely considered the foundation of optimal nutrition for companion parrots. Unlike seed mixes, pellets are designed to provide a nutritionally complete and balanced diet in every bite, preventing birds from selectively eating only their preferred (and often least nutritious) foods. The development of commercially available pelleted diets has been one of the most significant advances in companion bird nutrition, dramatically improving the health and longevity of pet parrots.

## Why Pellets Are Recommended

- **Nutritional completeness**: Pellets are formulated to contain the appropriate balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals that parrots need. Each pellet contains the same nutritional profile, eliminating selective feeding.
- **Prevention of deficiencies**: Seed-based diets are commonly deficient in vitamin A, calcium, and certain amino acids. Pellets address these gaps by incorporating all essential nutrients.
- **Reduced obesity risk**: Pellets generally contain less fat than seed-based diets, helping to prevent obesity and related conditions such as fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis).
- **Veterinary endorsement**: Most avian veterinarians recommend that pellets constitute 50-80% of a companion parrot's diet, with the remainder being fresh fruits, vegetables, and occasional healthy treats.

## Types of Pelleted Diets

- **Extruded pellets**: Made by cooking ingredients under high heat and pressure, producing a uniform, often colorful pellet. Common brands include Harrison's Bird Foods, Zupreem, and Roudybush.
- **Cold-pressed pellets**: Produced without high heat, which may preserve more heat-sensitive nutrients. Harrison's is a well-known producer of organic, cold-pressed formulations.
- **Nutriberries and foraging diets**: Products like Lafeber's Nutri-Berries combine pellet nutrition with whole grains and seeds in a round shape, encouraging foraging behavior while providing balanced nutrition.

## Pellet Size by Species

| Species Size | Pellet Size | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Small (budgies, lovebirds, parrotlets) | Fine / Small | Micro or small-sized pellets |
| Medium (conures, caiques, Senegals) | Small / Medium | Standard small pellets |
| Large (African Greys, Amazons, Eclectus) | Medium | Medium-sized pellets |
| Extra Large (Macaws, Cockatoos) | Medium / Large | Large or coarse pellets |

## What Pellets Should NOT Replace

Pellets should form the dietary base but should **not** be the only food offered. A healthy companion parrot diet also includes:
- Fresh vegetables (dark leafy greens, carrots, bell peppers, broccoli) -- daily
- Fresh fruits (apple, berries, melon) -- in moderation
- Occasional healthy treats (nuts, sprouted seeds)

A diet of 100% pellets, while better than 100% seeds, lacks the phytonutrients, variety, and enrichment that fresh foods provide.

## Choosing a Quality Pellet

- Look for pellets with whole-grain ingredients and minimal artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.
- Organic and non-GMO options are available (e.g., Harrison's Bird Foods).
- Avoid pellets with added sugar or excessive artificial dyes, which offer no nutritional benefit.
- Consult an avian veterinarian for brand recommendations specific to your bird's species and health needs.
