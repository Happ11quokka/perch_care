# Macaw Diet

## Overview

Macaws are the largest of the companion parrots, and they have unique nutritional needs that reflect their size and wild diet. In nature, macaws consume a diverse array of nuts, seeds, fruits, flowers, clay, and bark, with a higher fat intake than most other parrot species. Their powerful beaks are adapted to crack hard-shelled nuts, and their digestive systems are equipped to handle a higher-fat diet than smaller parrots. However, in captivity, this fat tolerance must be balanced against the reduced energy expenditure of cage life.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-60% | Large pellets or macaw-specific formulations |
| Fresh vegetables | 20-25% | Variety of colors and types |
| Fresh fruits | 10-15% | Macaws tolerate more fruit than some species |
| Nuts | 5-10% | Higher than most parrot species, but still controlled |

## Pellets

- Large or macaw-sized pellets from reputable brands.
- Macaw-specific formulations may contain slightly higher fat content (8-12%) to reflect their natural dietary needs.
- Nutri-Berries and other foraging-format pellets are especially suitable for macaws, as they encourage natural food manipulation.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, collard greens, romaine)
- Bell peppers, hot peppers (macaws enjoy spicy peppers)
- Carrots, sweet potato (cooked), butternut squash, pumpkin
- Broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, green beans
- Beets, parsnips, turnips
- Large macaws can be given whole vegetable pieces to encourage manipulation and foraging.

## Fresh Fruits

- Macaws naturally consume significant amounts of fruit in the wild.
- Offer a variety: mango, papaya, banana, berries, apple, grapes, melon, pomegranate, star fruit, passion fruit, figs, stone fruits (pits removed).
- Palm fruit is a natural food source for many wild macaw species.

## Nuts (Important Component)

Unlike most companion parrots, macaws benefit from a moderate nut component in their diet:
- **Brazil nuts**: Natural food for Hyacinth Macaws; excellent for all macaw species in moderation.
- **Macadamia nuts**, **walnuts**, **almonds**, **pecans**, **hazelnuts**: All appropriate.
- **In-shell nuts**: Offering nuts in the shell provides enrichment and beak exercise.
- **Limit**: Despite tolerance for higher fat, nuts should still be controlled (approximately 2-4 medium nuts per day for large macaws, fewer for Hahn's/small macaws).
- Overfeeding nuts leads to obesity even in macaws.

## Seeds

- A small amount of seed mix can supplement the diet.
- Sunflower and safflower seeds in moderation.
- Seeds are less important for macaws than nuts from a nutritional standpoint.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Macaw Wasting Disease (PDD)
- Proventricular Dilatation Disease is a concern in macaws. While diet cannot prevent PDD, maintaining optimal nutrition supports overall health and immune function.
- Birds with PDD may need dietary modification (smaller, more frequent meals; easily digestible foods) under veterinary guidance.

### Obesity in Smaller Macaws
- Hahn's Macaws and other mini-macaws are more prone to obesity than their larger relatives.
- Adjust nut and seed intake downward for smaller species.

### Beak Health
- Macaws' powerful beaks need regular exercise. Whole nuts in shells, hardwood toys, and cuttlebone support beak condition.

### Atherosclerosis
- While less commonly reported than in Amazons and African Greys, macaws can develop atherosclerosis with consistently high-fat diets.
- Balance nut intake with pellets and vegetables.

### Clay Consumption
- In the wild, macaws visit clay licks to consume mineral-rich clay, possibly to neutralize plant toxins and supplement minerals.
- Commercial bird-safe clay products are available but are not nutritionally necessary for captive macaws on balanced diets.

## Feeding Large Macaws

- Large macaws (Blue-and-Gold, Scarlet, Green-winged) eat approximately 10-15% of their body weight daily.
- They need robust food dishes that cannot be easily tipped or destroyed.
- Offer food in large, sturdy stainless steel bowls.
- Macaws are messy eaters -- they drop and waste significant food. This is natural foraging behavior.
