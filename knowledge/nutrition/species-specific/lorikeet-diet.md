# Lorikeet & Lory Diet

## Overview

Lorikeets and lories have the most specialized diet of any companion parrot group. Unlike seed- and nut-eating parrots, lorikeets are nectarivores -- their primary natural diet consists of nectar, pollen, fruits, and flowers. They possess a unique **brush-tipped tongue** adapted for extracting nectar from blossoms and a digestive system designed for processing liquid and soft foods. Feeding a standard parrot seed or pellet diet to lorikeets can cause serious health problems including crop impaction and malnutrition. Understanding and providing their specialized dietary needs is the most important aspect of lorikeet care.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Commercial lorikeet nectar formula | 50-60% | Wet or dry nectar mix -- the dietary staple |
| Fresh fruits | 25-30% | Major diet component |
| Fresh vegetables | 5-10% | Supplementary |
| Pollen/flowers | 5% | Natural supplement |
| Standard seeds/pellets | 0% | NOT appropriate for lorikeets |

## Commercial Lorikeet Nectar Formula

- This is the **non-negotiable dietary staple** for captive lorikeets.
- Available in two forms:
  - **Wet (liquid) nectar**: Pre-mixed liquid formula, served as-is or diluted.
  - **Dry (powder) nectar**: Powder mixed with water to create a liquid/slurry.
- Reputable brands: Vetafarm Neocare/Nectar, Passwell Lorikeet Food, Wombaroo Lorikeet & Honeyeater Food, Lafeber Lorikeet Pellets.
- **Preparation**: Mix according to manufacturer instructions. Use clean water. Prepare fresh daily.
- **Spoilage**: Nectar spoils rapidly in warm temperatures. Replace every 4-8 hours (more frequently in hot weather) to prevent bacterial growth.
- **Low-iron formulation**: Choose formulas specifically designed to be low in iron (see health section).

## Fresh Fruits (Daily -- Major Component)

Fruit is a significant part of the lorikeet diet and should be offered daily in generous amounts:
- Apple, pear (no seeds)
- Grapes
- Melon (watermelon, cantaloupe, honeydew)
- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)
- Mango, papaya
- Banana
- Kiwi
- Stone fruits (peaches, nectarines -- pits removed)
- Figs
- Orange and citrus (in moderation)

Chop fruits into manageable pieces. Lorikeets prefer soft, juicy fruits.

## Fresh Vegetables (Supplementary)

- Corn on the cob (a lorikeet favorite)
- Peas
- Grated carrot
- Bell peppers
- Broccoli (small florets)
- Leafy greens (offered but less readily consumed than fruits)

## Pollen and Flowers

- **Bee pollen granules**: Sprinkle over fruit as a natural dietary supplement mimicking wild pollen consumption.
- **Safe edible flowers**: Hibiscus, bottlebrush (*Callistemon*), grevillea, eucalyptus blossoms, and nasturtium. Offering flowering branches provides both nutrition and enrichment.
- Only offer flowers from pesticide-free sources.

## What NOT to Feed

- **Standard parrot seed mixes**: Lorikeets' gizzard is relatively weak compared to seed-eating parrots. Seeds can cause crop impaction and are nutritionally inappropriate.
- **Standard parrot pellets**: Most pellet formulations are designed for granivorous (seed-eating) parrots and are not appropriate for nectarivores.
- **High-iron foods**: See health section below.
- **Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic** -- toxic to all birds.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Iron Storage Disease (Hemochromatosis)
- The **most critical health concern** unique to lorikeets and other softbills.
- Lorikeets' digestive systems are adapted to a naturally low-iron diet (nectar and pollen).
- When fed diets with excessive iron, they absorb and store iron in the liver and other organs, eventually causing organ damage and death.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use commercial lorikeet nectar formulas specifically labeled as low-iron.
  - Avoid iron-rich foods: spinach, red meat, iron-fortified cereals or pellets.
  - Avoid citrus in excess, as vitamin C increases iron absorption.
  - Annual blood work to monitor iron levels is recommended.

### Bacterial and Yeast Infections
- The high-sugar nectar diet creates conditions favorable to bacterial and yeast (*Candida*) overgrowth in the crop if hygiene is poor.
- Change nectar frequently, wash food dishes thoroughly, and maintain clean cage conditions.

### Liquid Droppings
- Lorikeets produce frequent, watery, projectile droppings -- this is **normal** for their liquid-based diet.
- Cage setup must accommodate easy cleaning (splash guards, acrylic panels, washable surfaces).
- This is not diarrhea; it is the normal consistency for nectar-fed birds.

### Nutritional Deficiency from Improper Diet
- Feeding standard seed or pellet diets causes severe malnutrition, digestive problems, and significantly shortened lifespan.
- The specialized nectar-based diet is absolutely essential and non-negotiable.
