# Budgerigar Diet

## Overview

Budgerigars (budgies) are the most commonly kept companion bird worldwide, yet they are also among the most frequently malnourished. Many budgerigars are fed exclusively on seed mixes, leading to chronic vitamin A deficiency, iodine deficiency (goiter), obesity, fatty liver disease, and significantly shortened lifespan. A budgerigar on a balanced diet can live 12-15+ years, while those on seed-only diets often succumb to nutritional disease within 5-8 years.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-60% | Fine or extra-small pellets appropriate for budgerigar-sized birds |
| Fresh vegetables | 20-30% | Finely chopped or grated for their small beaks |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | Small pieces, offered in moderation |
| Seeds | 10% or less | As treats or foraging enrichment only |

## Pellets

- Use small-sized or "fine" pellets formulated for small parrots or budgerigars.
- Budgerigars are notoriously resistant to pellet conversion. Begin during the juvenile stage if possible.
- Brands commonly recommended: Harrison's Bird Foods (Super Fine), Roudybush (Nibles), Zupreem (Natural Small).

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Broccoli florets (rich in vitamins A and C)
- Grated carrot and sweet potato
- Finely chopped dark leafy greens (kale, romaine, dandelion greens)
- Bell pepper (all colors, especially red)
- Peas and corn (thawed frozen is convenient)
- Cucumber and zucchini
- Clip leafy greens to cage bars or offer in small dishes at perch level.

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Small pieces of apple (no seeds), berries, grapes, melon, kiwi, and banana.
- Fruit should not exceed 5-10% of total intake due to sugar content.

## Seeds

- Traditional budgerigar seed mixes (millet, canary seed, small amounts of oats) can be used as a minor supplement or training reward.
- **Avoid** mixes high in sunflower seeds or peanuts, which are too high in fat for budgerigars.
- Spray millet is an excellent training reward and enrichment item when used sparingly.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Iodine Deficiency (Goiter)
- Budgerigars are the species most commonly affected by iodine deficiency goiter.
- Provide an iodine-supplemented mineral block at all times.
- A pellet-based diet prevents iodine deficiency entirely.

### Obesity
- Budgerigars are prone to obesity on seed-heavy diets, leading to fatty tumors (lipomas) and hepatic lipidosis.
- Monitor body condition regularly. A healthy budgie should weigh 30-40 grams.
- Reduce seeds and increase vegetables and flight exercise to manage weight.

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Extremely common in seed-fed budgerigars. Leads to respiratory infections, mouth lesions, and poor feather quality.
- Orange and yellow vegetables (carrots, sweet potato, bell peppers) provide beta-carotene.

## Water

- Fresh, clean water daily. Change at least twice daily.
- Do not add vitamins or supplements to water unless directed by a veterinarian.
