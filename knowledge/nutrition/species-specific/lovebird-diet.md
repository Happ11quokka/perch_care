# Lovebird Diet

## Overview

Lovebirds (genus *Agapornis*) are active, energetic small parrots that require a nutrient-dense diet to match their high metabolic rate. In the wild, lovebirds feed on seeds, grains, fruits, berries, and vegetation. In captivity, a balanced diet based on pellets with fresh foods prevents the nutritional deficiencies common in seed-fed lovebirds and supports their 15-20 year potential lifespan.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-60% | Small-sized pellets |
| Fresh vegetables | 20-30% | Chopped small |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | In moderation |
| Seeds | 10-15% | As supplement and enrichment |

## Pellets

- Small-sized pellets appropriate for lovebird-sized birds.
- Lovebirds can be stubborn about dietary conversion but are generally more accepting than budgerigars if started young.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Dark leafy greens (kale, dandelion greens, Swiss chard, romaine)
- Carrots (grated or thinly sliced), sweet potato (cooked)
- Bell peppers (all colors), broccoli, peas, corn
- Green beans, zucchini, cucumber
- Lovebirds enjoy manipulating and shredding leafy greens, providing both nutrition and enrichment.

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries), apple (no seeds), grapes, banana, mango, melon, papaya, and figs.
- Lovebirds in the wild consume significant amounts of fruit and berries, so moderate fruit offerings align with their natural diet.

## Seeds

- A small parakeet/lovebird seed mix can supplement the diet.
- Millet sprays are excellent for foraging enrichment.
- Limit sunflower seeds due to high fat content.
- Sprouted seeds are an excellent nutritional bridge between seeds and fresh foods.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Obesity
- While less obesity-prone than budgerigars or cockatiels, lovebirds can become overweight on high-fat seed diets, especially if caged without adequate flight exercise.
- Healthy adult lovebird weight varies by species: Peach-faced 46-63g, Masked 43-55g, Fischer's 42-58g.

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Common in seed-fed lovebirds. Provide beta-carotene-rich vegetables daily.

### Calcium Needs
- Important for all lovebirds, critical for egg-laying females.
- Female lovebirds frequently lay eggs even without a mate, increasing calcium demand.
- Cuttlebone should always be available.

### Iron Storage (for species kept in mixed collections)
- Not a primary concern for lovebirds but relevant if housed near lorikeets or toucans that require low-iron diets.

## Foraging and Feeding Behavior

- Lovebirds are naturally active foragers. Incorporate foraging opportunities into feeding:
  - Hide food in shredding toys
  - Offer whole vegetables on skewers
  - Scatter seed in foraging trays with paper shreds
- They enjoy holding food items in their feet while eating.

## Water

- Fresh, clean water daily, changed at least twice.
- Lovebirds enjoy bathing; provide a separate shallow bath dish.
