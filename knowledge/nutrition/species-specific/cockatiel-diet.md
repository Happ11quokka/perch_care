# Cockatiel Diet

## Overview

Cockatiels are one of the most popular companion birds and, like budgerigars, are frequently kept on nutritionally inadequate seed-only diets. Cockatiels have a natural preference for high-fat seeds (particularly sunflower and safflower), making them especially prone to obesity and fatty liver disease. A properly balanced diet is essential for cockatiels to reach their potential lifespan of 15-25+ years.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-65% | Small-sized pellets for cockatiels |
| Fresh vegetables | 20-30% | Chopped to appropriate size |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | Limited due to sugar |
| Seeds | 10% or less | As treats only |

## Pellets

- Small-sized pellets appropriate for cockatiel-sized birds.
- Cockatiels can be challenging to convert from seeds to pellets. The gradual mixing method is generally most effective.
- Some cockatiels initially prefer colored or flavored pellets, which can serve as a bridge before transitioning to natural pellets.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Dark leafy greens: kale, Swiss chard, romaine lettuce, dandelion greens
- Orange/yellow vegetables: carrot, sweet potato (cooked), butternut squash, bell peppers
- Other: broccoli, peas, corn, green beans, zucchini
- Cockatiels often enjoy eating corn on the cob and whole pea pods as enrichment.

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Apple (no seeds), berries, melon, grapes, banana, mango, and papaya.
- Limit fruit to prevent excess sugar intake and potential yeast overgrowth.

## Seeds

- Traditional cockatiel seed mixes contain sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, millet, and canary seed.
- **Sunflower and safflower seeds should be limited** -- they are the most calorie-dense and least nutritious components.
- Spray millet is useful for training and foraging enrichment.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Obesity and Fatty Liver Disease
- Cockatiels are highly prone to obesity, especially females.
- Fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis) is one of the most common causes of death in cockatiels on seed diets.
- Monitor weight regularly. Healthy adult cockatiels typically weigh 80-120 grams.
- If overweight, gradually reduce seeds and increase vegetables and flight exercise.

### Lipomas
- Fatty tumors are common in overweight cockatiels.
- Dietary fat reduction and weight management can slow growth of existing lipomas.

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Common in seed-fed cockatiels. Leads to respiratory infections and sinus problems.
- Provide beta-carotene-rich vegetables daily.

### Night Frights and Nutrition
- Cockatiels are prone to night frights. While primarily a behavioral issue, nutritional status (particularly calcium and B vitamins) may influence nervous system stability.

## Calcium and Cuttlebone

- Cuttlebone should always be available, especially for female cockatiels who may lay eggs (even without a mate).
- Calcium-rich vegetables (kale, broccoli, bok choy) support overall calcium balance.

## Water

- Fresh, clean water daily, changed at least twice.
- Cockatiels are known for dunking food in their water. Extra water changes may be needed.
