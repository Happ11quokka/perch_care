# Cockatoo Diet

## Overview

Cockatoos (family Cacatuidae) encompass a range of species from the small Goffin's Cockatoo to the large Moluccan and Umbrella Cockatoos. All cockatoo species share a tendency toward obesity when fed high-fat diets in captivity, combined with their often sedentary cage lifestyle. In the wild, many cockatoo species spend hours foraging on the ground for seeds, roots, tubers, and insects, burning significant calories in the process. Captive cockatoos require carefully managed, low-fat diets with emphasis on vegetables and foraging enrichment.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 55-70% | Medium to large pellets, low-fat formula |
| Fresh vegetables | 25-30% | High-fiber, vitamin-rich selections |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | Limited due to sugar |
| Seeds/nuts | 2-5% | Strictly limited |

## Pellets

- Medium to large pellets depending on species size.
- Choose low-fat formulations (fat content 4-6%) to help prevent obesity.
- Cockatoos can be selective eaters. Offering Nutri-Berries or similar foraging-style pellet products can improve acceptance and provide enrichment.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, dandelion greens, collard greens)
- Root vegetables (carrots, sweet potato, beets) -- cooked or raw
- Bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts
- Peas, green beans, corn, sugar snap peas
- In the wild, several cockatoo species dig for roots and tubers. Offering root vegetables can satisfy this natural foraging instinct.

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Berries, apple (no seeds), pomegranate, melon, papaya, mango, kiwi
- Limit high-sugar fruits for overweight birds.

## Seeds and Nuts (Minimal)

- **Strictly limit to 2-5% of diet**.
- Cockatoos (especially Sulphur-crested, Umbrella, and Moluccan) are extremely prone to obesity and fatty liver disease on high-fat diets.
- Use individual nuts as high-value training rewards only.
- Major Mitchell's Cockatoos in the wild consume native pine seeds (*Callitris* spp.) -- small amounts of pine nuts can be offered as a species-appropriate treat.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Obesity and Fatty Liver Disease
- The number one nutritional concern for captive cockatoos.
- Sedentary cage life combined with high-fat diets creates rapid weight gain.
- Monitor weight monthly. Consult species-specific weight references.
- Encourage flight exercise and active foraging to increase caloric expenditure.

### Atherosclerosis
- Cockatoos are susceptible to atherosclerosis, particularly with long-term high-fat diets.
- Low-fat dietary management throughout life helps reduce risk.

### Lipomas
- Fatty tumors are common in overweight cockatoos, particularly Galahs and Sulphur-crested Cockatoos.
- Dietary fat reduction is the primary management strategy.

### Feather Destructive Behavior
- While primarily behavioral/psychological, nutritional deficiencies can contribute to feather plucking.
- A balanced diet is one component of comprehensive feather health management.
- Foraging enrichment at mealtimes addresses both nutritional and behavioral needs.

### PBFD and Immune Support
- Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease is a concern in cockatoos. While diet cannot prevent PBFD, optimal nutrition supports immune function.
- Ensure adequate vitamin A, vitamin E, and zinc from the diet.

## Foraging Enrichment (Critical for Cockatoos)

Cockatoos are among the species that benefit most from foraging-based feeding:
- Hide pellets and vegetables in foraging toys, paper cups, cardboard boxes
- Wrap food in paper or palm leaves
- Use puzzle feeders requiring manipulation
- Scatter food in a foraging tray with shredded paper
- Foraging extends feeding time, reduces boredom, and helps prevent behavioral problems.
