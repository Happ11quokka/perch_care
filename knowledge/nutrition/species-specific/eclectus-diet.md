# Eclectus Parrot Diet

## Overview

Eclectus Parrots (*Eclectus roratus*) have dietary requirements that differ from many other companion parrots. They possess an unusually long digestive tract relative to body size, which appears to make some individuals more sensitive to dietary excess (especially fortified vitamins/minerals). Eclectus parrots generally do well on a diet higher in fresh foods (fruits and vegetables), with pellets used as a supplement rather than the sole dietary base. Reports of sensitivity to artificial additives and aggressive fortification exist, but responses vary between individuals.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Fresh vegetables | 30-40% | The dietary cornerstone for Eclectus |
| Fresh fruits | 20-30% | Significantly higher than for most parrots |
| Pellets | 20-30% | Supplementary, preferably natural/organic |
| Seeds/nuts/legumes | 5-10% | Sprouted seeds, cooked legumes |

**Note**: The Eclectus diet is unusual in that fresh foods should form the majority (60-70%) of the diet, with pellets as a supplement rather than the base. This is the opposite of recommendations for most other companion parrot species.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily -- Primary Component)

- Dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, dandelion greens, endive, bok choy)
- Carrots (grated or chopped), sweet potato (cooked), butternut squash
- Bell peppers (all colors), hot peppers
- Broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, green beans
- Zucchini, cucumber, beets, parsnip
- Celery, fennel
- Sprouts (broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, mung bean sprouts)
- Eclectus parrots in the wild consume a wide variety of plant matter, flowers, buds, and leafy vegetation.

## Fresh Fruits (Daily -- Major Component)

- Pomegranate (an Eclectus favorite and highly nutritious)
- Papaya, mango
- Figs (a natural food in their range)
- Berries (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)
- Apple (no seeds), pear, grapes
- Melon, banana, kiwi, stone fruits (pits removed)
- Star fruit, passion fruit, guava

## Pellets (Supplementary)

- **Choose natural, organic pellets** without artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.
- **Harrison's Bird Foods** and **TOP's Parrot Food** are frequently recommended for Eclectus due to their organic, additive-free formulations.
- **Avoid pellets with artificial dyes** (Red 40, Yellow 5, etc.). Eclectus parrots are often reported as more sensitive to artificial additives, and these have been anecdotally linked to toe-tapping/wing-flipping in some birds.
- Pellets should supplement the fresh food diet, not replace it.

## Sprouted Seeds and Legumes

- Sprouted seeds (sunflower, mung bean, lentils, chickpeas, broccoli) are an excellent dietary component for Eclectus.
- Sprouting reduces fat content, increases protein and vitamin levels, and provides a food form that closely mimics natural wild foods.
- Cooked legumes (lentils, chickpeas, black beans) are another excellent protein and fiber source.

## Seeds and Nuts (Limited)

- Small amounts of dry seeds and nuts as treats or enrichment.
- Eclectus parrots need less fat in their diet than macaws; limit nuts to 1-2 per day.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Vitamin and Mineral Hypersensitivity
- The Eclectus parrot's long digestive tract (which is proportionally longer than in most parrots) results in **very efficient nutrient absorption**.
- This may increase susceptibility to **hypervitaminosis** (vitamin excess) when heavily fortified pellets and synthetic supplements are overused.
- Suspected signs of vitamin/mineral excess may include toe-tapping, wing-flipping, muscle spasms, and feather abnormalities.
- **Solution**: Base the diet on fresh, natural foods rather than heavily fortified pellets. Avoid synthetic vitamin supplements unless prescribed by an avian veterinarian.

### Toe-Tapping and Wing-Flipping
- Repetitive toe-tapping and wing-flipping movements are relatively specific to Eclectus parrots.
- While the exact cause is debated, dietary factors (particularly artificial additives, synthetic vitamins, and fortified foods) are commonly implicated.
- Switching to a diet of fresh foods with additive-free pellets often resolves or reduces these behaviors.

### Feather Quality
- Eclectus parrots are famous for their spectacular plumage (bright red in females, green in males). Poor diet directly impacts feather quality.
- A diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables, and natural beta-carotene sources supports their vivid feather coloration.
- Artificial dyes in pellets have been anecdotally associated with dull feather color and feather texture changes.

### Vitamin A
- Despite their efficient absorption, adequate vitamin A (from natural beta-carotene sources) is important.
- Orange and red vegetables and fruits provide ample beta-carotene.

## Feeding Tips

- Offer the largest meal of fresh foods in the morning.
- Prepare a "chop" mix (finely chopped mixture of vegetables, fruits, sprouts, and cooked grains) for convenient daily feeding.
- Remove uneaten fresh food after 2-4 hours.
- Eclectus parrots are generally enthusiastic about fresh foods and less resistant to dietary variety than many other species.
