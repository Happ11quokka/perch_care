# African Grey Parrot Diet

## Overview

African Grey Parrots (*Psittacus erithacus* and *Psittacus timneh*) are highly intelligent birds with specific nutritional needs that distinguish them from most other companion parrots. Most notably, African Greys are uniquely susceptible to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium), making calcium and vitamin D3 management a critical priority. They also have higher requirements for certain nutrients, including beta-carotene and vitamin A. A balanced, carefully managed diet is essential for their potential 40-60+ year lifespan.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-65% | Medium-sized pellets |
| Fresh vegetables | 25-30% | Emphasis on calcium and vitamin A-rich options |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | In moderation |
| Nuts | 5% | As treats (especially palm nuts, almonds, walnuts) |

## The Calcium Priority

African Greys have a species-specific predisposition to hypocalcemia that is not fully understood but may relate to unique calcium metabolism, vitamin D3 requirements, or parathyroid hormone regulation.

### Calcium Supplementation
- **Cuttlebone**: Must always be available.
- **Calcium-rich vegetables daily**: Kale, broccoli, bok choy, collard greens, dandelion greens.
- **Liquid calcium**: Calcium glubionate or calcium gluconate may be recommended by your avian veterinarian, especially for birds showing early signs of deficiency.
- **UVB lighting**: Critical. African Greys housed indoors without UVB light exposure cannot adequately synthesize vitamin D3, which is required for calcium absorption.

### Signs of Hypocalcemia
- Seizures (most common emergency presentation)
- Muscle tremors and twitching
- Weakness and falling from perch
- Incoordination

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily -- Emphasis on Calcium & Vitamin A)

- **High calcium**: Kale, broccoli, bok choy, collard greens, dandelion greens
- **High vitamin A**: Carrots, sweet potato (cooked), red bell peppers, butternut squash
- **Other**: Peas, corn, green beans, zucchini, Brussels sprouts

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Pomegranate, berries, apple (no seeds), grapes, mango, papaya, melon, fig
- Palm fruit: In their natural West African habitat, African Greys consume large quantities of oil palm fruit. Some owners offer palm nuts as a species-appropriate treat.

## Nuts

- African Greys naturally consume nuts in the wild and benefit from moderate nut inclusion.
- **Palm nuts**: Species-appropriate and highly relished.
- **Almonds, walnuts, pecans, Brazil nuts**: Offer in small quantities (2-3 nuts per day maximum).
- Nuts provide healthy fats but are calorie-dense; limit to prevent obesity.

## Seeds

- Seeds should be minimal (5% or less) in the African Grey diet.
- Use primarily for foraging enrichment rather than nutrition.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Common in seed-fed African Greys. Leads to respiratory infections, sinus disease, and immune suppression.
- Daily orange/yellow vegetables and dark leafy greens prevent deficiency.

### Atherosclerosis
- African Greys are among the species most prone to atherosclerosis (cholesterol plaque in arteries).
- Maintain a low-fat diet and minimize seeds and high-fat treats.

### Obesity
- Less common than in Amazons or cockatoos but can occur with excessive nut and seed intake.
- Monitor weight regularly (healthy range approximately 400-550g depending on subspecies and individual).

### Feather Destructive Behavior
- While primarily behavioral, nutritional deficiencies (particularly vitamin A and calcium) can contribute to feather plucking.
- A complete, balanced diet is part of a comprehensive approach to feather health.
