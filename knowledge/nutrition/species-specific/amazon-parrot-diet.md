# Amazon Parrot Diet

## Overview

Amazon parrots are among the most obesity-prone companion bird species. Their natural enthusiasm for eating, combined with a tendency toward a sedentary cage lifestyle, makes dietary management a top priority. In the wild, Amazons are active flyers that consume a varied diet of fruits, seeds, nuts, flowers, and leafy vegetation. In captivity, their relatively low activity levels mean they require fewer calories than many owners provide, and excess weight directly contributes to atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, and shortened lifespan.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 60-70% | Medium-sized, low-fat formulation |
| Fresh vegetables | 25-30% | High-fiber, nutrient-dense choices |
| Fresh fruits | 5-10% | Limited due to sugar content |
| Seeds/nuts | 2-5% | Strictly limited |

## The Obesity Priority

Amazon parrots (particularly Blue-fronted, Yellow-naped, and Double Yellow-headed Amazons) are exceptionally prone to obesity. Key management principles:

- **Low-fat diet**: Choose pellet formulations with fat content at the lower end of the range (4-6%).
- **Minimize seeds and nuts**: These should be rare treats, not daily staples.
- **Maximize vegetables over fruits**: Vegetables are lower in calories and sugar.
- **Encourage exercise**: Out-of-cage time, flight exercise, and foraging activities burn calories.
- **Regular weight monitoring**: Weigh monthly. Healthy weight varies by species (typically 300-500g depending on species).

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily -- High Fiber, Low Calorie)

- Dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, collard greens, romaine, dandelion greens)
- Bell peppers (all colors), hot peppers
- Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts
- Carrots, sweet potato (cooked), butternut squash
- Peas, green beans, sugar snap peas, corn
- Zucchini, cucumber

## Fresh Fruits (Strictly Limited)

- Berries (lower sugar than tropical fruits)
- Apple (no seeds), melon, papaya, kiwi
- Avoid high-sugar fruits like banana and grapes in large quantities for overweight birds.
- Fruit should be treated as occasional enrichment, not a dietary staple.

## Seeds and Nuts (Minimal)

- **2-5% of diet maximum**. Amazon parrots love seeds and nuts and will overeat them given the opportunity.
- Use individual nuts (one almond or walnut piece) as high-value training rewards.
- Avoid sunflower and safflower seed bowls entirely.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Atherosclerosis
- Amazon parrots are one of the species most prone to atherosclerosis, alongside African Greys and cockatoos.
- High-fat diets accelerate arterial plaque formation.
- Maintain strictly low-fat dietary management throughout life.
- Sudden death from cardiac events can occur in older Amazons with advanced atherosclerosis.

### Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)
- Directly correlated with high-fat diets and obesity.
- Can progress to liver failure if not addressed.
- Dietary intervention (low-fat pellets, increased vegetables, weight management) can improve liver function.

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Common in seed-fed Amazons despite their love of fresh foods.
- Ensure daily intake of beta-carotene-rich vegetables.

### Hormonal Behavior and Diet
- Amazons are notoriously hormonal, especially during breeding season.
- High-fat, high-calorie diets can exacerbate hormonal behavior (aggression, territorial behavior).
- Reducing caloric intake and avoiding warm, soft, high-fat foods during hormonal periods may help reduce intensity.

### Lipomas
- Fatty tumors common in overweight Amazons.
- Dietary fat reduction and weight management are primary treatments.

## Feeding Strategy

- Offer pellets as the primary food throughout the day.
- Provide fresh vegetables in the morning when the bird is hungriest.
- Reserve any seeds or nuts exclusively for training sessions.
- Remove uneaten fresh food after 2-4 hours.
- Avoid sharing high-fat, high-sodium human foods (chips, crackers, bread, cheese).
