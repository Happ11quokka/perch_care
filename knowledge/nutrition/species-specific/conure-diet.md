# Conure Diet

## Overview

Conures encompass a diverse group of medium-sized parrots including Green-cheeked, Sun, Jenday, and Nanday Conures, among others. These active, playful birds have moderate to high energy requirements and benefit from a varied, balanced diet. In the wild, conures feed on seeds, fruits, berries, nuts, flowers, and vegetation. Captive conures fed seed-only diets commonly develop vitamin A deficiency, obesity, and fatty liver disease.

## Ideal Diet Composition

| Component | Percentage | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Pellets | 50-65% | Small to medium-sized pellets |
| Fresh vegetables | 20-25% | Variety of colors and types |
| Fresh fruits | 10-15% | Conures tend to enjoy fruit |
| Seeds/nuts | 5-10% | As treats and enrichment |

## Pellets

- Small to medium-sized pellets depending on species (Green-cheeked Conures do well with small pellets; larger conures may prefer medium).
- Conures are generally more adventurous eaters than budgerigars or cockatiels and may accept pellets more readily.

## Fresh Vegetables (Daily)

- Bell peppers (all colors -- conures love these)
- Dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, collard greens, dandelion greens)
- Carrots, sweet potato (cooked), butternut squash
- Broccoli, cauliflower, peas, corn, green beans
- Sugar snap peas (a conure favorite)
- Hot peppers (jalapeño, habanero -- birds lack capsaicin receptors and many conures love spicy peppers)

## Fresh Fruits (In Moderation)

- Conures tend to be fruit-enthusiastic. Popular choices include: apple, berries, grapes, mango, papaya, melon, banana, kiwi, pomegranate, and stone fruits (pits removed).
- Monitor fruit intake to prevent excessive sugar consumption.

## Seeds and Nuts

- Small amounts of a quality seed mix can be offered for enrichment.
- Nuts (almonds, walnuts, pecans) in small quantities as training rewards.
- Conures enjoy foraging for seeds -- use foraging toys and puzzle feeders.

## Special Nutritional Concerns

### Conure Bleeding Syndrome
- Some conures (particularly Green-cheeked and related *Pyrrhura* species) may be susceptible to bleeding episodes thought to be related to vitamin K deficiency or calcium imbalance.
- Ensure adequate vitamin K from leafy green vegetables (kale, broccoli, Swiss chard).
- A pellet-based diet with daily greens typically prevents this condition.

### Vitamin A Deficiency
- Common in seed-fed conures. Manifests as respiratory infections, sinus problems, and poor feather quality.
- Orange and dark green vegetables provide beta-carotene.

### Obesity
- Sun Conures and Jenday Conures can be prone to weight gain. Monitor body condition and limit high-fat seeds and nuts.
- Green-cheeked Conures are generally more active and less obesity-prone but still require a balanced diet.

### Feather Health
- A varied diet rich in protein, vitamin A, and omega fatty acids supports the brilliant plumage conures are known for.
- During molting, increase protein-rich foods (cooked egg, legumes).

## Feeding Enrichment

- Conures are highly food-motivated and benefit from foraging enrichment.
- Skewer vegetables and fruits on stainless steel kabob holders.
- Use puzzle feeders and foraging boxes.
- Offer whole items when possible (whole pea pods, chunks of bell pepper, broccoli stalks).

## Water

- Fresh, clean water daily. Many conures enjoy bathing in their water dish -- provide a separate bath or change water frequently.
