# Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (*Cacatua galerita*)

## Overview

The Sulphur-crested Cockatoo is one of the most iconic and widely recognized parrot species in the world. Native to Australia, New Guinea, and parts of Indonesia, this large white cockatoo is instantly identifiable by its striking yellow forward-curving crest. Known for their exceptional intelligence, bold personalities, and remarkable longevity, Sulphur-crested Cockatoos are both beloved companion birds and prominent wild birds across their range. They are highly social, extremely destructive chewers, and capable of living well beyond 70 years, making ownership a truly lifelong commitment that may need to be planned across generations.

### Subspecies
1. **Cacatua galerita galerita** - Greater Sulphur-crested Cockatoo (eastern and southeastern Australia)
2. **Cacatua galerita fitzroyi** - Fitzroy's Cockatoo (northern Australia)

4. **Cacatua galerita eleonora** - Eleonora Cockatoo (Aru Islands, Indonesia)

No widely established color mutations are recognized in captivity.

## Temperament & Personality

### Noise Level
**Very high.** Sulphur-crested Cockatoos are loud birds with powerful vocalizations. Their natural calls include piercing screeches and raucous screaming, particularly at dawn and dusk. While not quite as loud as the Moluccan Cockatoo, their volume is still significant enough to be problematic in residential settings, especially apartments or homes with shared walls.

### Talking Ability
Moderate to good. Sulphur-crested Cockatoos can develop a reasonable vocabulary and some individuals become quite competent talkers. They are adept at mimicking sounds, whistles, and household noises. Their speech is often clear and they can learn contextually appropriate phrases.

### Temperament
- **Highly intelligent**: Exceptional problem-solving abilities; wild populations have been documented learning to open garbage bins and teaching the behavior to others
- **Bold and confident**: Outgoing personality, not easily intimidated
- **Destructive chewers**: Among the most destructive of all cockatoo species; they have an intense need to chew and can demolish furniture, woodwork, and inadequate cages
- **Social and playful**: Enjoy interactive play, games, and social engagement with their owners
- **Long-lived commitment**: Their extraordinary lifespan means ownership must be planned as a multi-decade (potentially multi-generational) commitment
- **Can be independent**: Compared to Umbrella and Moluccan Cockatoos, they may show slightly more independence, though they still require extensive social interaction
- **Territorial**: Can become aggressive during breeding season or when protecting their cage space
- **Energetic**: High-energy birds that need significant physical and mental stimulation daily

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 36" x 48" x 60" or larger; given their size and energy, the biggest enclosure possible is recommended
- **Cage construction**: Heavy-gauge stainless steel is strongly recommended; their powerful beaks can destroy standard powder-coated cages over time
- **Bar spacing**: 1 to 1.5 inches
- **Locks**: Multiple cockatoo-proof padlocks; these birds are masterful escape artists
- **Perches**: Sturdy natural wood branches of varying diameters; expect perches to be destroyed regularly and plan for replacement
- **Chew materials**: Provide abundant wood blocks, leather strips, and destructible items to redirect chewing behavior away from cage components
- **Outdoor aviary**: If possible, access to a secure outdoor aviary provides excellent enrichment and natural sunlight exposure

### Diet
- **Base diet**: 75-80% high-quality formulated pellets appropriate for large cockatoos
- **Fresh produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables and fruits daily (broccoli, kale, sweet potato, carrots, corn, apples, berries, grapes)
- **Healthy supplements**: Small portions of cooked brown rice, whole-grain pasta, or legumes
- **Treats**: Limited nuts (macadamia, almonds, walnuts) and seeds; use primarily as training rewards
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, high-fat processed foods, and excessive sunflower seeds
- **Fresh water**: Clean water available at all times
- **Weight management**: Monitor weight regularly, as captive Sulphur-crested Cockatoos are prone to obesity

### Exercise & Enrichment
- **Out-of-cage time**: Minimum 3-4 hours daily of supervised out-of-cage time; more is preferred
- **Toys**: Heavy-duty, destructible toys that can withstand powerful beaks; rotate frequently
- **Foraging**: Foraging toys, puzzle feeders, and hidden food challenges are essential for mental stimulation
- **Chewing outlets**: Provide safe wood blocks, cardboard, and natural branches for chewing
- **Training**: Highly responsive to positive reinforcement training; trick training provides excellent mental exercise
- **Physical activity**: Encourage climbing, wing flapping, and active play
- **Bathing**: Regular bathing through misting, rain showers, or shallow water dishes
- **Environmental variety**: Exposure to different environments (supervised outdoor time in a carrier or harness) enriches their lives

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral disease caused by circovirus that leads to progressive feather loss, beak deformities, and immune suppression. No cure; management is supportive. Particularly concerning in this species. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)** | Common in birds on high-fat diets with insufficient exercise. Symptoms include obesity, lethargy, and abnormal feather coloration. Requires dietary correction and veterinary management. |
| **Obesity** | Captive birds are prone to weight gain due to calorie-rich diets and limited activity. Contributes to fatty liver disease, heart problems, and reduced lifespan. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Can be triggered by stress, boredom, hormonal changes, or medical conditions. While potentially less common than in Umbrella or Moluccan Cockatoos, it remains a significant risk. |
| **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)** | Bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*. Symptoms include respiratory distress, lethargy, and discharge. Treatable with antibiotics; zoonotic (can spread to humans). |
| **Aspergillosis** | Fungal respiratory infection caused by *Aspergillus* species. Can be acute or chronic. Linked to stress, poor ventilation, and immunosuppression. |
| **Bumblefoot (Pododermatitis)** | Infection and inflammation of the foot, often caused by inappropriate perch surfaces, obesity, or inactivity. Requires veterinary treatment and husbandry corrections. |

Regular avian veterinary checkups (at least annually) are essential, including blood panels, fecal examination, and thorough physical assessment.

## Breeding Information

- **Sexual maturity**: Typically reached at 5-6 years of age
- **Clutch size**: Usually 2-3 eggs per clutch
- **Incubation period**: Approximately 25-27 days; both parents participate in incubation
- **Fledging**: Chicks fledge at approximately 10-12 weeks
- **Nesting**: In the wild, they nest in large tree hollows, often at great heights. Captive breeding requires a large, sturdy nest box (L-shaped or boot-style boxes are commonly used)
- **Pair bonding**: Form strong, long-term monogamous pair bonds
- **Breeding behavior**: Males perform elaborate courtship displays including crest raising, head bobbing, and wing spreading
- **Breeding challenges**: Male aggression toward the female can be an issue; adequate space and monitoring are required. Wing clipping of the male is sometimes employed as a safety measure for the female.
- **Seasonal breeding**: In the wild, breeding typically occurs from August to January in southern Australia; captive birds may breed year-round under controlled conditions
