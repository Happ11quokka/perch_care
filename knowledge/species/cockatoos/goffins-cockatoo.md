# Goffin's Cockatoo (*Cacatua goffiniana*)

## Overview

The Goffin's Cockatoo, also known as the Tanimbar Corella, is the smallest of all white cockatoo species. Native to the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia, this diminutive cockatoo has earned a reputation as one of the most intelligent and entertaining companion parrots available. Scientific research has documented remarkable cognitive abilities in this species, including spontaneous tool-making and use -- a behavior once thought to be exclusive to primates and corvids. Despite their smaller size, Goffin's Cockatoos are energetic, mischievous, and highly playful birds that require significant mental stimulation. Their Near Threatened conservation status in the wild underscores the importance of responsible captive breeding and habitat conservation.

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Cacatuidae |
| **Scientific Name** | *Cacatua goffiniana* |
| **Origin** | Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia |
| **Size** | 30-32 cm (12-13 inches) |
| **Weight** | 250-400 g |
| **Lifespan** | 30-40 years in captivity |
| **Conservation Status** | Near Threatened (IUCN) |

## Appearance

The Goffin's Cockatoo is a compact, small cockatoo with subtle coloration:

- **Plumage**: Predominantly white, clean and bright across the body
- **Pink accents**: Delicate salmon-pink coloration near the base of the beak and around the eyes, giving the face a warm, blushing appearance
- **Crest**: Small and rounded compared to other cockatoo species; white, and can be raised when excited or alarmed but is far less dramatic than the crests of larger cockatoos
- **Beak**: Pale grey to bone-colored, relatively short and compact for a cockatoo; upper mandible is hooked
- **Eyes**: Dark brown irises surrounded by a prominent bare whitish-blue periorbital ring (which contributes to the occasional nickname "bare-eyed little corella")
- **Underwings**: Faint yellowish wash on the undersides of the flight feathers
- **Feet**: Grey, zygodactyl
- **Sexual Dimorphism**: Minimal visual differences; females may have slightly lighter (reddish-brown) irises compared to males (dark brown to black). DNA sexing is recommended for reliable identification.

No established color mutations are widely available in captive-bred populations.

## Temperament & Personality

### Noise Level
**Moderate.** While Goffin's Cockatoos are less noisy than larger cockatoo species such as the Moluccan or Umbrella Cockatoo, they are still vocal birds. They produce a range of calls, chattering, and occasional loud screeches. Their noise level is generally more manageable in a home setting, though they should not be considered quiet birds.

### Talking Ability
Moderate. Some Goffin's Cockatoos can learn a small vocabulary of words and phrases, though they are not known as prolific talkers. They are more inclined to mimic sounds and environmental noises. Their strength lies in their physical expressiveness and problem-solving abilities rather than verbal communication.

### Temperament
- **Energetic and playful**: Constantly active and inquisitive; they enjoy exploring their environment and engaging with objects
- **Mischievous**: Known for getting into things, opening containers, and figuring out how to bypass barriers -- they are natural escape artists
- **Excellent problem-solvers**: Scientifically documented tool-making and tool-use abilities. Research has shown they can fashion tools from raw materials to reach food rewards, demonstrating advanced cognitive abilities
- **Affectionate**: While less intensely clingy than larger cockatoos, they still form strong bonds and enjoy physical affection
- **Social**: Thrive on interaction but may tolerate moderate periods alone better than their larger relatives
- **Curious**: Highly inquisitive nature means they investigate everything in their environment
- **Prone to boredom**: Without adequate mental stimulation, they can develop destructive behaviors and stereotypic movements
- **Agile**: Excellent climbers and acrobats; they use their feet dexterously to manipulate objects

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 24" x 36" x 48" -- although smaller than other cockatoos, they are active birds and benefit from the largest cage possible
- **Cage construction**: Powder-coated wrought iron or stainless steel; while their beaks are less powerful than larger cockatoos, they are still capable chewers
- **Bar spacing**: 3/4 to 1 inch
- **Locks**: Cockatoo-proof locks are essential; Goffin's Cockatoos are arguably the most adept of all cockatoo species at defeating cage locks and latches
- **Perches**: Multiple perches of varying sizes and textures; include natural wood branches
- **Puzzle elements**: Include foraging stations and interactive elements within the cage layout
- **Location**: Social area of the home; they thrive on being part of household activities

### Diet
- **Base diet**: 75-80% high-quality formulated pellets sized for small to medium parrots
- **Fresh produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables and fruits daily (broccoli, spinach, sweet peppers, carrots, blueberries, apples, pomegranate)
- **Healthy additions**: Small amounts of cooked grains, legumes, and sprouted seeds
- **Treats**: Limited nuts and seeds; use primarily as training rewards
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, and high-fat/high-sodium processed foods
- **Fresh water**: Clean water at all times, changed daily
- **Weight management**: Despite their smaller size, Goffin's Cockatoos are prone to obesity; monitor food intake and body condition carefully

### Exercise & Enrichment
- **Out-of-cage time**: Minimum 3-4 hours daily of supervised out-of-cage time
- **Puzzle toys**: Foraging toys and puzzle feeders are particularly important for this intellectually gifted species
- **Interactive toys**: Toys with moving parts, locks, knots, and hidden compartments appeal to their problem-solving nature
- **Destructible toys**: Provide shredding and chewing materials (paper, soft wood, palm leaf)
- **Training**: Highly trainable through positive reinforcement; trick training, target training, and complex task learning provide excellent mental stimulation
- **Supervised exploration**: Allow safe exploration of bird-proofed rooms; their curiosity and dexterity mean they will investigate everything
- **Bathing**: Regular misting or shallow bath opportunities; many enjoy water play
- **Social play**: Interactive games and activities with their owner strengthen the bond and provide stimulation

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Feather Plucking** | Can occur due to boredom, stress, or lack of mental stimulation. While potentially less common than in the larger, more emotionally demanding cockatoo species, it remains a risk, particularly in under-stimulated birds. |
| **Obesity** | A significant concern in captive Goffin's Cockatoos, especially those fed a seed-heavy diet or given too many fatty treats. Regular weight monitoring is essential. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral disease affecting feathers, beak, and immune system. No cure exists; prevention through biosecurity and testing is key. |
| **Behavioral Issues** | Under-stimulated Goffin's Cockatoos may develop repetitive behaviors, excessive screaming, or destructive tendencies. Their high intelligence means they need consistent mental challenges. |

Regular veterinary checkups with an avian veterinarian are recommended at least annually, including blood work and physical examination.

## Breeding Information

- **Sexual maturity**: Typically reached at 3-4 years of age (earlier than larger cockatoo species)
- **Clutch size**: Usually 2-3 eggs per clutch
- **Incubation period**: Approximately 24-26 days; both parents share incubation duties
- **Fledging**: Chicks fledge at approximately 8-10 weeks
- **Nesting**: In the wild, they nest in tree hollows. Captive breeding requires an appropriately sized nest box (L-shaped or boot-style boxes are preferred)
- **Pair bonding**: Form monogamous pair bonds
- **Breeding notes**: Generally less aggressive during breeding season compared to larger cockatoo species, though male aggression can still occur
- **Conservation significance**: As a Near Threatened species, responsible captive breeding contributes to the genetic reservoir for the species. Wild populations face pressure from habitat destruction and trapping for the pet trade
