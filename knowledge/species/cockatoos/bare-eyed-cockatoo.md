# Bare-eyed Cockatoo (*Cacatua sanguinea*)

## Overview
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo (also known as the Little Corella or Blood-stained Cockatoo) is a medium-sized white cockatoo native to Australia and parts of New Guinea. Named for its distinctive bare, blue-grey periorbital skin patch around the eye, this species is one of the most widespread cockatoos in Australia and has gained popularity as a companion bird due to its playful, clownish personality and remarkable talking ability. Among cockatoos, the Bare-eyed is considered one of the more manageable species for experienced bird owners.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Cacatuidae (Subfamily: Cacatuinae)
- **Origin**: Widespread across Australia, particularly in arid and semi-arid inland regions; also found in parts of southern New Guinea. Feral populations established in urban areas of major Australian cities.
- **Size**: 35-40 cm (14-16 inches)
- **Weight**: 370-530 g (approximately 13-19 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 40-60 years in captivity, with some individuals reported to exceed 70 years with excellent care

## Appearance
The Bare-eyed Cockatoo is predominantly white with a short, rounded crest that lies relatively flat against the head. The most distinctive feature is the large, bare blue-grey periorbital ring (eye patch) of exposed skin surrounding the eye, which gives the species its common name. Between the eye and the beak, there is a small patch of pink-salmon colored feathers, which inspired the alternative name "Blood-stained Cockatoo." The underwings and undertail show pale yellow wash. The beak is pale horn-white to greyish, relatively short and broad. The eyes are dark brown in males and reddish-brown in females (one of the few reliable visual sex indicators). The legs are grey.

Sexual dimorphism is subtle. Males tend to be slightly larger with a broader head and darker brown eyes. Females typically have a reddish-brown iris, slightly smaller head, and may show a more pronounced pink lore patch.

Color mutations are rare in captivity. Occasional cinnamon and lutino individuals have been reported but are not widely established.

## Temperament & Personality
- **Noise level**: Moderate to high. They can produce loud, screeching calls, though they are generally quieter than larger cockatoos such as Moluccan or Umbrella Cockatoos. Their natural flock calls can be quite loud, especially during morning and evening.
- **Talking ability**: Excellent for a cockatoo. Bare-eyed Cockatoos are among the best talkers in the cockatoo family. Many individuals develop vocabularies of 50+ words and can speak in context. They also mimic household sounds, whistles, and tunes.
- **Temperament**: Playful, clownish, affectionate, and intelligent. They are often described as the "class clown" of the cockatoo world, frequently performing acrobatic tricks, dancing, and engaging in silly antics. They bond strongly to their owners and crave attention and interaction.
- **Activity pattern**: Diurnal and highly active. They are energetic birds that need significant stimulation throughout the day. They are enthusiastic chewers and will destroy anything within reach.
- **Social behavior**: Extremely social and flock-oriented. In the wild, they congregate in enormous flocks numbering in the thousands. In captivity, they require extensive daily interaction with their owner. They can develop behavioral problems (screaming, feather destructive behavior, aggression) if neglected. They generally do well with other cockatoo species but should be supervised.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 90 cm x 60 cm x 120 cm (36" x 24" x 48") for a single bird. Larger is strongly recommended -- a walk-in aviary or very large cage is ideal.
- **Bar spacing**: 2-2.5 cm (3/4" to 1")
- **Setup**: Heavy-duty stainless steel or powder-coated cage with secure locks (they are expert escape artists). Multiple sturdy perches of varying diameters, including natural hardwood branches. Abundant destructible toys -- wooden blocks, leather strips, woven palm and vine toys, cardboard, and untreated pine. They need a constant supply of chewing material to maintain beak health and prevent boredom.
- **Cage strength**: The cage must be durable. Bare-eyed Cockatoos have powerful beaks and will bend or break weak cage bars and dismantle flimsy locks.
- **Flight space**: They are strong flyers and benefit greatly from an aviary or flight cage. Regular supervised out-of-cage time in a bird-safe room is essential.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 50-60%). Medium-sized formulated pellets designed for cockatoos are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A small amount of seed mix (approximately 10-15%) as supplementation. Avoid excessive sunflower seeds and other high-fat seeds, as cockatoos are prone to obesity.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens, carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, green beans, peas, corn, sweet potato, and squash.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of apple, berries, grapes, banana, melon, mango, and pomegranate.
- **Nuts**: Almonds, walnuts, and pecans in small quantities as training treats. Limit due to high fat content.
- **Sprouted seeds and legumes**: Excellent nutritional supplement.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, fruit seeds/pits, and excessive fatty foods.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Bare-eyed Cockatoos require extensive daily exercise and mental stimulation. Provide a minimum of 3-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- They are voracious chewers and MUST have a constant rotating supply of destructible items. Untreated wooden blocks, branches (eucalyptus, apple, willow), woven grass and palm toys, cardboard boxes, paper towel rolls, and leather strips are essential. Without adequate chewing material, they will redirect their destructive energy toward furniture, walls, or their own feathers.
- Foraging toys are highly recommended -- puzzle feeders, hidden treat boxes, and wrapped food items keep them mentally engaged.
- They enjoy bathing and should be offered showers or a large water dish for bathing several times per week.
- Trick training is excellent for mental stimulation and bonding. They are highly trainable and enjoy learning new behaviors.
- Social interaction with their owner is non-negotiable. These are flock animals that suffer greatly from isolation.

## Common Health Issues
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus infection causing progressive feather loss, beak deformities, and immune suppression. A significant concern in cockatoos.
- **Feather destructive behavior (FDB)**: Self-mutilation and feather plucking, often triggered by stress, boredom, hormonal imbalance, or insufficient social interaction. One of the most common behavioral issues in cockatoos.
- **Obesity and fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Very common in cockatoos fed high-fat seed diets with insufficient exercise.
- **Lipomas (fatty tumors)**: Benign fatty growths, frequently associated with obesity and high-fat diets.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Aspergillosis**: Fungal respiratory infection, particularly in birds with compromised immune systems or poor ventilation.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Avian bornavirus infection affecting the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system.
- **Chronic egg laying and reproductive issues**: Single females may lay excessively, risking calcium depletion and egg binding.
- **Sarcocystosis**: Parasitic infection that can cause acute death, particularly in cockatoos housed outdoors where they may be exposed to infected opossum feces.
- **Bumblefoot (pododermatitis)**: Foot infections from improper perching surfaces or inactivity.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Approximately 3-4 years of age, though some may breed as early as 2-3 years.
- **Clutch size**: 2-4 eggs, typically 2-3.
- **Incubation period**: 24-26 days. Both parents share incubation duties.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 7-8 weeks (49-56 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 12-14 weeks after hatching.
- **Nest box**: A sturdy wooden or metal-reinforced nest box approximately 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm (12" x 12" x 24") with a 10 cm (4") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings or decayed wood.
- They are relatively easy to breed in captivity compared to some other cockatoo species.
- Both parents participate in incubation and chick rearing, making them attentive and cooperative parents.
- In the wild, they nest in tree hollows, often in eucalyptus trees near water sources.
- Breeding pairs should be housed separately to prevent aggression.
