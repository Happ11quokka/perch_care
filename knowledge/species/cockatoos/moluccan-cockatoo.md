# Moluccan Cockatoo (*Cacatua moluccensis*)

## Overview

The Moluccan Cockatoo, also known as the Salmon-crested Cockatoo, is one of the largest and most striking cockatoo species. Native to the South Moluccas region of Indonesia, particularly Seram Island, this species is distinguished by its beautiful salmon-pink plumage tones and dramatic retractable crest. The Moluccan Cockatoo is widely regarded as one of the most emotionally demanding companion parrots, requiring an extraordinary level of dedication from its owner. With a VULNERABLE conservation status in the wild due to habitat loss and trapping, responsible ownership and captive breeding are increasingly important for the species' long-term survival.

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Cacatuidae |
| **Scientific Name** | *Cacatua moluccensis* |
| **Origin** | South Moluccas / Seram Island, Indonesia |
| **Size** | 50 cm (20 inches) |
| **Weight** | 700-1000 g |
| **Lifespan** | 50-80+ years in captivity |
| **Conservation Status** | Vulnerable (IUCN) |

## Appearance

The Moluccan Cockatoo is one of the most visually impressive cockatoo species, featuring a distinctive warm coloration:

- **Plumage**: Predominantly white with a soft salmon-pink suffusion throughout the body feathers, most pronounced on the chest, underwings, and undertail
- **Crest**: Large, broad, and retractable; deep salmon-pink to reddish-orange when raised, creating a dramatic and colorful display
- **Beak**: Grey-black, large, and powerful with a strong hooked upper mandible
- **Eyes**: Dark brown to black irises
- **Eye Ring**: Bare whitish-blue periorbital skin
- **Feet**: Grey, zygodactyl
- **Sexual Dimorphism**: Subtle; females may have slightly lighter irises (reddish-brown) compared to males (dark brown to black), though this is not always a reliable indicator. DNA sexing is recommended for definitive identification.

No widely established color mutations exist in captive populations.

## Temperament & Personality

### Noise Level
**Extremely high.** The Moluccan Cockatoo is widely considered one of the LOUDEST of all cockatoo species, and indeed one of the loudest of all parrots. Their screams can reach painful decibel levels and carry over significant distances. This makes them unsuitable for apartment or townhouse living and potentially problematic even in detached homes with close neighbors.

### Talking Ability
Moderate. Moluccan Cockatoos can learn a limited vocabulary of words and phrases. They are better known for their ability to mimic sounds, whistles, and environmental noises. Their communication is more often expressed through body language, crest displays, and vocalizations rather than speech.

### Temperament
- **Extremely affectionate**: Often described as the ultimate "velcro bird," the Moluccan Cockatoo craves near-constant physical contact and emotional connection
- **Deeply bonding**: Forms intensely strong bonds with its primary caregiver, often to the exclusion of other family members
- **Emotionally complex**: Highly sensitive to changes in routine, environment, and the emotional state of its owner
- **Needy**: Requires constant companionship and stimulation; does not tolerate being left alone for extended periods
- **Intelligent**: Quick learners capable of problem-solving and understanding complex social dynamics
- **Prone to behavioral extremes**: When their emotional needs are not met, Moluccan Cockatoos can develop severe behavioral problems including incessant screaming, aggression, and self-destructive behaviors
- **Gentle when well-adjusted**: A properly socialized Moluccan can be remarkably gentle and sweet-natured

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 36" x 48" x 60" or larger; given their size, the largest possible enclosure is recommended
- **Cage construction**: Heavy-gauge stainless steel; Moluccan Cockatoos have extremely powerful beaks that can destroy standard cages
- **Bar spacing**: 1 to 1.5 inches
- **Locks**: Multiple cockatoo-proof locks are essential; these intelligent birds quickly learn to defeat simple latch mechanisms
- **Perches**: Multiple natural wood perches of varying diameters; include java wood or manzanita for durability
- **Play area**: A separate play stand or play gym outside the cage for supervised out-of-cage time
- **Location**: Central living area where the bird can observe and participate in family life

### Diet
- **Base diet**: 75-80% high-quality formulated pellets designed for large cockatoos
- **Fresh produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables and fruits daily (dark leafy greens, sweet potato, peppers, carrots, berries, mango, papaya)
- **Healthy additions**: Small amounts of cooked whole grains, legumes, and sprouted seeds
- **Treats**: Nuts (almonds, walnuts) in limited quantities due to high fat content
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, high-fat and high-sodium foods
- **Fresh water**: Clean water available at all times, changed at least twice daily
- **Supplements**: Cuttlebone or calcium supplement, especially for breeding females

### Exercise & Enrichment
- **Out-of-cage time**: Minimum 4-6 hours daily; more is preferable
- **Toys**: Large, destructible toys that satisfy the strong chewing drive; rotate toys frequently to prevent boredom
- **Foraging**: Foraging toys and puzzle feeders are essential for mental stimulation
- **Social interaction**: Extensive daily interaction including talking, handling, training, and shared activities
- **Bathing**: Regular bathing opportunities through misting, shower perches, or shallow water dishes
- **Environmental enrichment**: Music, television, or radio when the owner is away can help reduce isolation stress (though this is not a substitute for direct interaction)
- **Training**: Positive reinforcement training sessions help channel energy and strengthen the bond

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Feather Plucking** | Very common in Moluccan Cockatoos, often triggered by stress, boredom, hormonal changes, or lack of socialization. Can become a chronic, deeply ingrained behavior. |
| **Beak Overgrowth** | Can occur due to nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, or lack of appropriate chewing materials. Requires veterinary trimming. |
| **Aspergillosis** | A fungal infection of the respiratory system caused by *Aspergillus* species. Can be acute or chronic; often linked to stress, poor ventilation, or immunosuppression. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)** | Common in birds fed high-fat, seed-heavy diets with insufficient exercise. Can progress to liver failure. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral disease affecting feather growth, beak integrity, and immune function. Incurable; management is supportive. |
| **Behavioral Problems** | Screaming, aggression, and self-mutilation are common in birds whose social and emotional needs are unmet. Professional avian behaviorist consultation may be necessary. |
| **Self-Mutilation** | In severe cases of psychological distress, Moluccan Cockatoos may inflict serious wounds on themselves, requiring emergency veterinary care and long-term behavioral intervention. |

Annual checkups with a certified avian veterinarian are critical, including blood work, fecal analysis, and physical examination.

## Breeding Information

- **Sexual maturity**: Typically reached at 5-7 years of age
- **Clutch size**: Usually 2 eggs (occasionally 1 or 3)
- **Incubation period**: Approximately 28-30 days; both parents share incubation duties
- **Fledging**: Chicks typically fledge at 14-16 weeks
- **Nesting**: In the wild, they nest in large tree hollows; captive breeding requires a very large, sturdy nest box (typically a grandfather-style box or barrel)
- **Pair bonding**: Form strong, monogamous pair bonds
- **Breeding challenges**: Male aggression toward the female is a significant concern during breeding season; careful monitoring and provision of adequate space and escape routes for the female are essential
- **Conservation note**: Due to their Vulnerable conservation status, captive breeding programs play an important role. However, the emotional demands of this species mean that breeding should only be undertaken by experienced aviculturists
