# Galah / Rose-breasted Cockatoo (*Eolophus roseicapilla*)

## Overview

The Galah, also known as the Rose-breasted Cockatoo or Pink and Grey Cockatoo, is one of the most visually distinctive and widespread cockatoo species. Native to Australia, where it is one of the most common and abundant cockatoo species across the continent, the Galah is easily recognized by its striking pink and grey plumage. Unlike many cockatoo species that are facing population declines, the Galah has thrived alongside human agricultural development and expanded its range significantly. As a companion bird, the Galah is prized for its playful, clownish personality, moderate noise level relative to other cockatoos, and beautiful coloration. Their more manageable temperament makes them an excellent choice for those who are drawn to cockatoos but may find the larger species too demanding.

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Cacatuidae |
| **Scientific Name** | *Eolophus roseicapilla* |
| **Origin** | Australia (widespread across the continent) |

## Appearance

The Galah is one of the most colorful and visually distinctive cockatoo species, standing out vividly from the predominantly white cockatoos:

- **Chest and face**: Rich rose-pink coloration covering the chest, belly, lower face, and cheeks -- the signature feature of this species
- **Back and wings**: Smooth, medium grey covering the back, wings, and upper tail
- **Tail**: Grey on the upper surface; pinkish-grey underneath
- **Crest**: Pale pink to whitish-pink, smaller and less dramatic than most cockatoo crests; can be raised when excited or alarmed
- **Beak**: Bone-colored to pale horn, relatively small and compact for a cockatoo
- **Eyes**: Males typically have dark brown to black irises; females have pink to reddish-pink irises (one of the more reliable visual methods of sex determination among cockatoos)
- **Eye Ring**: Bare grey-pink periorbital skin
- **Feet**: Grey, zygodactyl

### Color Mutations
Several color mutations have been established in captive-bred Galah populations:
- **Lutino**: Yellow and pink coloration replacing the grey, with red eyes
- **Silver**: Diluted grey coloration, appearing lighter and more silvery
- **White (Albino)**: Very rare; all-white or extremely pale pink plumage
- **Cinnamon**: Warm brownish tones replacing the standard grey

## Temperament & Personality

### Noise Level
**Moderate.** Galahs are notably less noisy than most other cockatoo species, which is one of their significant advantages as companion birds. They do vocalize with chattering, whistles, and occasional screeches, but their calls are generally less shrill and less frequent than those of Umbrella, Moluccan, or Sulphur-crested Cockatoos. They are still not quiet birds by household standards, but they are among the most manageable cockatoos in terms of noise.

### Talking Ability
Moderate. Galahs can learn some words and short phrases, though they are not considered among the best talking parrot species. Males may be slightly more inclined to develop speech than females. They are more adept at mimicking whistles, tunes, and environmental sounds. Their vocalizations are often described as endearing and comical.

### Temperament
- **Playful and clownish**: Known for their comedic, acrobatic antics; Galahs are entertaining and joyful companions
- **Affectionate**: Form strong bonds with their owners and enjoy physical affection, head scratches, and cuddling
- **Less demanding than larger cockatoos**: While they still need significant social interaction, they are generally more independent than Umbrella or Moluccan Cockatoos
- **Energetic**: Active birds that enjoy climbing, swinging, and physical play
- **Social**: Thrive in social environments and do well in homes with regular activity
- **Mischievous**: Enjoy exploring and getting into mild trouble; their playful nature is a hallmark of the species
- **Adaptable**: Generally adjust well to household routines and can be more tolerant of reasonable changes in schedule
- **Good family birds**: Often more tolerant of multiple family members than some larger cockatoo species that bond exclusively to one person

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 30" x 36" x 48" -- the largest cage feasible is always recommended
- **Cage construction**: Powder-coated wrought iron or stainless steel; their beaks are less destructive than larger cockatoos but still capable of significant chewing
- **Bar spacing**: 3/4 to 1 inch
- **Locks**: Cockatoo-proof locks recommended; Galahs are curious and may learn to open simple latches
- **Perches**: Multiple natural wood perches of varying diameters and textures
- **Toys**: Include swings, ladders, and climbing structures to encourage their active, acrobatic nature
- **Location**: Social area of the home; they enjoy being part of family activities

### Diet
- **Base diet**: 75-80% high-quality formulated pellets designed for medium-sized cockatoos
- **Fresh produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables and fruits daily (dark leafy greens, carrots, sweet potato, peppers, zucchini, apples, pears, berries)
- **Careful fat management**: This is critically important for Galahs. They are particularly prone to obesity and fatty liver disease in captivity. Avoid excessive nuts, seeds, and high-fat treats.
- **Seeds and nuts**: Extremely limited quantities; use only as occasional training rewards
- **Healthy additions**: Small portions of cooked whole grains and legumes
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, sunflower seed-heavy diets, and high-fat processed foods
- **Fresh water**: Clean water available at all times, changed daily
- **Weight monitoring**: Regular weighing (weekly or biweekly) is recommended to catch weight gain early

### Exercise & Enrichment
- **Out-of-cage time**: Minimum 3-4 hours daily of supervised out-of-cage time
- **Physical activity**: Encourage active play, climbing, wing flapping, and acrobatic behavior; Galahs are naturally athletic and need physical outlets
- **Toys**: Provide a variety of toys including swings, rings, foraging toys, and destructible items
- **Foraging**: Foraging toys and puzzle feeders help replicate natural feeding behaviors
- **Training**: Respond well to positive reinforcement training; trick training is an excellent outlet for their playful nature
- **Bathing**: Regular bathing opportunities through misting or shallow water dishes; many Galahs enjoy rain showers and water play
- **Outdoor time**: Supervised outdoor time in a secure carrier or aviary provides natural sunlight and environmental enrichment
- **Exercise priority**: Given their susceptibility to obesity, ensuring adequate daily exercise is especially important for this species

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)** | One of the most common health concerns for captive Galahs. Their naturally lower activity levels compared to wild counterparts, combined with calorie-rich captive diets, make them highly susceptible. Careful dietary management is the primary preventive measure. |
| **Obesity** | Closely linked to fatty liver disease. Captive Galahs are less active than their wild counterparts and prone to weight gain. A low-fat, pellet-based diet with limited seed and nut intake is essential. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral disease affecting feathers, beak, and immune system. No cure; prevention through testing and biosecurity is important. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Can occur due to stress, boredom, hormonal fluctuations, or underlying medical conditions. While generally less prone to plucking than the more emotionally demanding cockatoo species, it remains a risk. |
| **Respiratory Infections** | Can be caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal agents. Symptoms include nasal discharge, labored breathing, and lethargy. Prompt veterinary attention is essential. |

Regular avian veterinary checkups (at least annually) are important, with particular attention to weight, liver values in blood panels, and overall body condition.

## Breeding Information

- **Sexual maturity**: Typically reached at 3-4 years of age
- **Clutch size**: Usually 3-5 eggs (larger clutches than most cockatoo species)
- **Incubation period**: Approximately 24-26 days; both parents share incubation duties
- **Fledging**: Chicks fledge at approximately 7-8 weeks (relatively quickly compared to larger cockatoos)
- **Nesting**: In the wild, they nest in tree hollows, often in eucalyptus trees. Captive breeding requires an appropriately sized nest box
- **Pair bonding**: Form monogamous pair bonds; wild pairs may remain together for many years
- **Breeding notes**: Generally less aggressive during breeding season compared to larger cockatoo species, making them somewhat more manageable in a breeding setting
- **Visual sexing**: The eye color difference between males (dark brown/black iris) and females (pink/reddish iris) is one of the most reliable visual sex determination methods among cockatoos, becoming apparent at maturity
- **Wild populations**: Galahs are prolific breeders in the wild and have expanded their range in Australia significantly due to agricultural land clearing, which has created favorable habitat
