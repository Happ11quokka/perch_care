# Umbrella Cockatoo (*Cacatua alba*)

## Overview

The Umbrella Cockatoo, also known as the White Cockatoo, is one of the most popular and recognizable cockatoo species kept as a companion bird. Named for its large, broad crest that fans out like an umbrella when raised, this species is renowned for its extremely affectionate nature and strong bonding with its owners. Often referred to as a "velcro bird," the Umbrella Cockatoo demands significant time, attention, and commitment from its caretaker, making it best suited for experienced bird owners who can dedicate substantial daily interaction.

## Appearance

The Umbrella Cockatoo is an all-white bird with a striking and elegant appearance. Key physical features include:

- **Plumage**: Entirely white feathering across the body, wings, and tail
- **Crest**: A broad, backward-curving white crest that fans out dramatically when the bird is excited, alarmed, or displaying emotion -- resembling an open umbrella
- **Beak**: Dark grey to black, strong and hooked, capable of significant bite force
- **Eye Ring**: Pale blue periorbital skin (bare skin around the eyes), which can appear more prominent during emotional states
- **Feet**: Grey, zygodactyl (two toes forward, two backward)
- **Sexual Dimorphism**: Minimal; males may have slightly darker (nearly black) irises, while females tend to have reddish-brown irises

No widely recognized color mutations exist in captive-bred Umbrella Cockatoos, as breeding efforts have focused on the standard all-white form.

## Temperament & Personality

### Noise Level
**High.** Umbrella Cockatoos are among the louder parrot species. They are capable of extremely loud screaming, particularly at dawn and dusk, when seeking attention, or when distressed. Their vocalizations can reach levels uncomfortable for close neighbors, making them poorly suited for apartment living.

### Talking Ability
Moderate. While not the most prolific talkers, Umbrella Cockatoos can learn a modest vocabulary of words and phrases. They are more inclined toward mimicking sounds, whistles, and household noises than developing an extensive spoken vocabulary.

### Temperament
- **Extremely affectionate**: Known as "velcro birds" for their intense desire to be physically close to their owners at all times
- **Cuddly and gentle**: They actively seek head scratches, petting, and being held
- **Emotionally sensitive**: Highly attuned to their owner's moods and household dynamics
- **Demanding**: Require 4-6 hours of daily out-of-cage interaction and socialization
- **Prone to behavioral issues**: Lack of attention or stimulation can lead to screaming, feather plucking, and self-mutilation
- **Playful**: Enjoy toys, games, and interactive activities with their owners
- **Strong bonding**: May bond excessively to one person and become jealous or aggressive toward others

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 36" x 48" x 60" (width x depth x height)
- **Cage construction**: Heavy-duty stainless steel or powder-coated wrought iron; Umbrella Cockatoos are powerful chewers and can bend or break thin cage bars
- **Bar spacing**: 1 to 1.5 inches
- **Locks**: Cockatoo-proof locks are essential, as these birds are adept at opening simple latches
- **Perches**: Multiple perches of varying diameters and materials (natural wood branches preferred)
- **Location**: In a social area of the home where the bird can be part of family activities, away from drafts, direct sunlight, and kitchen fumes

### Diet
- **Base diet**: 75-80% high-quality formulated pellets
- **Fresh produce**: 20-25% fresh fruits and vegetables daily (leafy greens, carrots, peppers, berries, apples, etc.)
- **Treats**: Nuts (sparingly, as they are high in fat), seeds in limited quantities
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onions, garlic, and high-fat/high-salt processed foods
- **Fresh water**: Clean, fresh water available at all times; water dishes should be changed daily
- **Calcium**: Cuttlebone or mineral block should be available, especially for females

### Exercise & Enrichment
- **Out-of-cage time**: Minimum 4-6 hours daily of supervised out-of-cage time
- **Toys**: Rotate a variety of destructible and foraging toys regularly; these birds have a strong need to chew
- **Foraging**: Hide food in foraging toys to stimulate natural behavior and mental engagement
- **Social interaction**: Daily hands-on interaction, talking, training sessions, and play
- **Bathing**: Regular misting or shallow bath opportunities; many Umbrella Cockatoos enjoy water
- **Training**: Positive reinforcement training provides mental stimulation and strengthens the human-bird bond

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Feather Plucking** | Extremely common in this species; often caused by stress, boredom, lack of social interaction, or underlying medical conditions. Can escalate to self-mutilation if not addressed. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | A viral disease caused by circovirus that affects the beak, feathers, and immune system. No cure exists; management is supportive. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)** | Often caused by a high-fat, seed-based diet and insufficient exercise. Can lead to liver failure if untreated. |
| **Obesity** | Common in captive birds due to high-calorie diets and limited physical activity. Contributes to fatty liver disease and other conditions. |
| **Behavioral Issues** | Screaming, biting, aggression, and self-mutilation often stem from inadequate socialization, lack of routine, or environmental stressors. |
| **Self-Mutilation** | In severe cases, feather plucking can progress to skin mutilation and tissue damage, requiring veterinary intervention and behavioral modification. |

Regular veterinary checkups with an avian veterinarian are essential. Annual wellness exams should include blood panels, gram stains, and physical examinations.

## Breeding Information

- **Sexual maturity**: Typically reached at 5-6 years of age
- **Clutch size**: Usually 2 eggs per clutch
- **Incubation period**: Approximately 28-30 days
- **Fledging**: Chicks fledge at approximately 12-14 weeks
- **Nesting**: In the wild, they nest in tree hollows; captive breeding requires a large, sturdy nest box
- **Pair bonding**: Umbrella Cockatoos form strong monogamous pair bonds
- **Breeding challenges**: Captive breeding can be difficult; aggression between mates can occur, and hand-reared birds may have difficulty bonding with a mate
