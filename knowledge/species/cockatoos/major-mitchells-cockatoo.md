# Major Mitchell's Cockatoo (*Lophochroa leadbeateri*)

## Overview
Major Mitchell's Cockatoo (also known as Leadbeater's Cockatoo or the Pink Cockatoo) is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful cockatoo species in the world. Native to the arid and semi-arid interior of Australia, this species is named after Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, a surveyor and explorer who admired the bird during his expeditions. With its stunning salmon-pink plumage and spectacular multicolored crest, this cockatoo is a prized but demanding companion that requires an experienced bird owner with significant time and resources to dedicate to its care.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Cacatuidae (sometimes placed in its own genus *Lophochroa*, distinct from *Cacatua*)
- **Origin**: Arid and semi-arid interior of Australia, including parts of Western Australia, South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland, and the Northern Territory. Prefers dry woodland, scrubland, and areas near watercourses.
- **Size**: 33-40 cm (13-16 inches)
- **Weight**: 340-425 g (approximately 12-15 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 40-60 years in captivity, with some individuals reported to live up to 75 years or more

## Appearance
Major Mitchell's Cockatoo is breathtakingly beautiful. The plumage is predominantly white to soft salmon-pink, with deeper pink on the face, neck, breast, and underparts. The underwings reveal a vivid deep salmon-pink. The most spectacular feature is the large, forward-curving crest, which when raised displays alternating bands of bright scarlet-red, yellow, and white -- creating a dramatic, flame-like display. The beak is pale horn-colored, relatively small for a cockatoo. The eyes are dark brown, and the legs are grey.

Sexual dimorphism is present and relatively reliable for visual sexing:
- **Males**: Eyes are dark brown to blackish. The crest has a broader red band with a narrow yellow band (or no yellow).
- **Females**: Eyes are reddish-pink to burgundy (the most reliable distinguishing feature). The crest has a wider yellow band between the red and white bands, creating a more multicolored effect.

Color mutations are extremely rare. Occasional lutino individuals have been reported but are not established in aviculture.

## Temperament & Personality
- **Noise level**: Moderate. They are generally quieter than most large cockatoos (such as Sulphur-crested or Moluccan Cockatoos). Their calls are melodious and less harsh, though they can still be loud when excited or seeking attention.
- **Talking ability**: Limited to moderate. Some individuals learn a few words or phrases, but they are not known as strong talkers. They are more likely to whistle tunes and mimic environmental sounds.
- **Temperament**: More independent and less overtly cuddly than many other cockatoo species. They can be affectionate with their primary caregiver but tend to be one-person birds and may become aggressive toward others. They can be sensitive, temperamental, and prone to jealousy. They require patience and consistent, gentle handling.
- **Activity pattern**: Diurnal, with moderate activity levels. They are less hyperactive than Goffin's or Bare-eyed Cockatoos but still require daily enrichment and interaction.
- **Social behavior**: They form strong bonds with a single person and can become possessive. They may not tolerate other birds well, especially other cockatoos, and can be territorial. They require careful socialization from a young age to prevent one-person bonding issues.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 90 cm x 60 cm x 120 cm (36" x 24" x 48") for a single bird. A larger enclosure or flight cage is strongly recommended. Outdoor aviaries are ideal where climate permits.
- **Bar spacing**: 2-2.5 cm (3/4" to 1")
- **Setup**: Sturdy cage with secure locks. Multiple perches of varying diameters and materials, including natural hardwood branches (eucalyptus, apple, or willow). Abundant toys for chewing and foraging -- they are moderately destructive and need regular access to chewable materials. Swings, foraging toys, and puzzle feeders are appreciated.
- **Environmental sensitivity**: They can be sensitive to stress and environmental changes. A calm, predictable environment is beneficial. Avoid placing the cage in high-traffic or noisy areas.
- **Flight space**: They are capable flyers and benefit from flight cages, aviaries, or supervised out-of-cage flight time in a bird-safe room.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 40-50%). Medium-sized formulated pellets are appropriate. They may be resistant to converting from seeds to pellets, requiring patience.
- **Seeds**: A moderate amount of native and low-fat seed mix (approximately 20-25%), including grass seeds, safflower, oat groats, and limited sunflower. In the wild, they feed extensively on seeds of native plants including pine seeds (*Callitris* spp.), melon seeds, and various weed seeds.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens, carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, peas, corn, sweet potato, and squash.
- **Fresh fruits**: Apple, berries, melon, stone fruits, pomegranate, and native Australian fruits.
- **Nuts**: Almonds, pine nuts, and walnuts in moderation. In the wild, they eat seeds from native conifers and are adapted to a diet that includes moderate fat from seeds.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits. Limit high-fat seeds to prevent obesity.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Major Mitchell's Cockatoos need daily out-of-cage time and enrichment. Provide at least 3-4 hours of supervised interaction and exercise daily.
- They enjoy foraging activities. Scatter food in foraging trays, wrap treats in paper, or use puzzle feeders to stimulate natural foraging behavior.
- They are moderate chewers and need access to chewable toys, natural branches, and destructible materials, though they are less destructive than some other cockatoo species.
- Bathing via gentle misting or a shallow dish is enjoyed and helps maintain feather condition.
- They can be trained with patience and positive reinforcement. Training sessions provide excellent mental stimulation and strengthen the bond with their owner.
- Avoid over-cuddling, especially along the back and under the wings, as this can trigger hormonal behavior and increase aggression or bonding issues.

## Common Health Issues
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus infection causing feather abnormalities, beak deformities, and immune suppression. A significant concern in all cockatoo species.
- **Feather destructive behavior (FDB)**: Self-plucking and feather destruction from stress, boredom, hormonal imbalance, or insufficient social interaction.
- **Obesity and fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Common in captive cockatoos fed high-fat diets with insufficient exercise.
- **Lipomas (fatty tumors)**: Benign fatty growths associated with obesity.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection with respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Aspergillosis**: Fungal respiratory infection, particularly in immunocompromised individuals or poor ventilation environments.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Avian bornavirus causing gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms.
- **Cloacal prolapse**: Can occur in breeding females or birds with straining issues.
- **Sarcocystosis**: Parasitic infection, a concern for birds housed in outdoor aviaries.
- **Behavioral issues**: Aggression, screaming, and self-mutilation can develop if social and environmental needs are not met.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Approximately 4-5 years of age.
- **Clutch size**: 2-5 eggs, typically 3-4.
- **Incubation period**: 23-26 days. Both parents share incubation duties, with the male typically incubating during the day and the female at night.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 7-8 weeks (49-56 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 12-16 weeks after hatching. Major Mitchell's chicks can be slow to wean and should not be rushed.
- **Nest box**: A sturdy wooden nest box approximately 30 cm x 30 cm x 60 cm (12" x 12" x 24") or a natural log hollow with a 10 cm (4") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings and decayed wood.
- Major Mitchell's Cockatoos can be challenging to breed in captivity. They are selective about mates and may not accept a paired partner.
- In Australia, they are protected under wildlife conservation laws and require permits for keeping and breeding.
- They are territorial during breeding and should be housed as isolated pairs, well away from other cockatoos.
- Aggression between the pair can occur; careful monitoring is essential during the breeding season.
