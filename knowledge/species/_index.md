## Notes
- All documents follow a standardized template covering: Overview, Basic Information, Appearance, Temperament & Personality, Care Requirements (Housing, Diet, Exercise & Enrichment), Common Health Issues, Breeding Information, and References.
- Each document includes references to real veterinary and avian care sources (VCA Hospitals, Lafeber, Merck Veterinary Manual, The Spruce Pets, PetMD, Beauty of Birds, etc.).
- Species categorization by size is based on typical adult body weight. Note that the Cockatiel (~80–120g) is placed in the "Small" category per avicultural convention, despite some individuals exceeding 100g.
- The Hahn's Macaw is categorized under Macaws despite its small size (~130–170g) due to its taxonomic classification and macaw-specific care considerations.
