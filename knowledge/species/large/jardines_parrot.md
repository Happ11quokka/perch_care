# Jardine's Parrot (*Poicephalus gulielmi*)

## Overview

Jardine's Parrot, also known as the Red-fronted Parrot, is a medium-to-large member of the Poicephalus genus -- a group of African parrots known for their compact build, intelligence, and relatively manageable temperament. Among the Poicephalus species, Jardine's is the largest and is prized for its attractive plumage, good talking ability, and comparatively quiet nature. They are intelligent, social birds that bond closely with their owners and can make excellent companions. However, like African Greys, they are highly susceptible to calcium deficiency, which makes proper diet and supplementation critically important.

| **Size** | 25-28 cm (10-11 inches) |
| **Weight** | 200-300 g |
| **Lifespan** | 30-60 years in captivity |
| **Conservation Status** | Least Concern |

## Appearance

Jardine's Parrot is a compact, solidly built bird with predominantly green plumage. The feathers of the body have distinctive black edges, creating an attractive scalloped or scaled appearance across the back, wings, and breast. The most eye-catching feature is the vivid orange-red patches found on the forehead (forecrown), the thighs, and the bend of the wings. The intensity and extent of these orange-red patches vary between individuals and subspecies.

The beak is dark grey to black, robust and strong for the bird's size. The eyes are dark with a grey-brown iris. The feet are grey-black. Overall, the Jardine's Parrot has a stocky, athletic build with a relatively short, square tail typical of the Poicephalus genus.

### Subspecies Variations

Three subspecies are recognized, differing primarily in the extent and intensity of their orange-red markings:
- *P. g. gulielmi* (nominate): From central Democratic Republic of Congo. Moderate orange-red patches.
- *P. g. fantiensis*: From West Africa (Ghana, Ivory Coast). Smaller, with less extensive orange markings.
- *P. g. massaicus*: From East Africa (Kenya, Tanzania). Often has the most vivid and extensive orange-red patches.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Good. Jardine's Parrots are capable talkers that can develop a moderate vocabulary with clear pronunciation. While not matching the exceptional abilities of African Greys or Amazons, they are above average among parrots and many individuals learn to speak with good clarity and context.
- **Noise Level**: Relatively quiet. This is one of the key advantages of the Jardine's Parrot as a companion bird. While they can produce loud calls, they are generally much quieter than Amazons, cockatoos, and macaws, making them more suitable for apartment living or noise-sensitive environments.
- **Temperament**: Intelligent, social, and playful. Jardine's Parrots are active and curious birds that enjoy interacting with their owners and exploring their environment. They tend to be confident without being overly demanding and are less prone to the dramatic hormonal swings seen in Amazon parrots. They can be strong-willed at times and benefit from consistent, positive training.
- **Social Needs**: Moderate to high. They enjoy and require daily interaction but are generally less dependent than African Greys. They can entertain themselves with toys and foraging activities for reasonable periods.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 24" x 24" x 36" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch
- Despite their somewhat smaller size, Jardine's Parrots are active climbers and players that benefit from as much space as possible.
- Provide a variety of perches, including natural wood branches of different diameters.
- Include climbing opportunities -- ladders, ropes, and elevated platforms.
- The cage should be positioned in a socially active area of the home where the bird can participate in family activities.

### Diet

- **Pellets**: 20-40% of the diet should consist of high-quality formulated pellets.
- **Seeds and Grains**: A balanced seed blend can form part of the diet, combined with cooked grains (brown rice, quinoa, barley).
- **Fresh Produce**: 30-40% fresh vegetables, leafy greens, and limited fruit (dark leafy greens, carrots, peppers, sweet potato, green beans, broccoli, berries).
- **Calcium and Vitamin D3**: Critically important. Jardine's Parrots, like African Greys, are highly susceptible to hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency), particularly when maintained on seed-heavy diets. Calcium-rich foods (kale, broccoli, almonds), cuttlebone, and potentially veterinarian-recommended calcium supplements should be provided. Access to natural sunlight or full-spectrum UV lighting is essential for vitamin D3 synthesis, which enables calcium absorption.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and exclusively seed-based diets.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- Provide 2-3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- Jardine's Parrots are energetic and enjoy foot toys, bells, and interactive toys.
- Foraging opportunities are important -- hide treats in paper, wood, and foraging toys.
- They are athletic birds that enjoy climbing and hanging, so provide appropriate structures.
- Training sessions using positive reinforcement are effective and enjoyable for this intelligent species.
- Regular bathing through misting or a shallow water dish is appreciated and supports feather health.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hypocalcemia** | Critical concern for Jardine's Parrots, particularly those on seed-based diets. Calcium deficiency can cause seizures, weakness, tremors, and bone deformities. Proper diet, calcium supplementation, and UV lighting or outdoor sun exposure for vitamin D3 synthesis are essential preventive measures. |
| **Vitamin D3 Deficiency** | Closely linked to hypocalcemia. Without adequate vitamin D3 (synthesized through UV exposure), the bird cannot properly absorb dietary calcium. Indoor birds without UV lighting are at particular risk. |
| **Aspergillosis** | Fungal respiratory infection caused by Aspergillus species. Maintain clean, well-ventilated living areas and avoid moldy bedding, food, or substrate. |
| **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)** | Bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*. Zoonotic (transmissible to humans). Symptoms include respiratory distress, lethargy, and green droppings. Treatable with appropriate antibiotics. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Can occur due to stress, dietary deficiencies (particularly calcium), boredom, or medical conditions. |

## Breeding Information

Jardine's Parrots reach sexual maturity at approximately 3-5 years of age. In the wild, they nest in tree cavities in montane and lowland forests. In captivity, breeding pairs require a secure nest box (approximately 10" x 10" x 18") mounted high in the aviary. The typical clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an incubation period of approximately 26-28 days. The female primarily incubates while the male provides food. Chicks fledge at approximately 10-11 weeks.

Jardine's Parrots are not as commonly bred in captivity as some other Poicephalus species (such as Senegal Parrots), and finding unrelated breeding pairs can be challenging. DNA sexing is required, as the species is not sexually dimorphic. Breeding birds require a calcium-rich diet to support healthy egg production and chick development.
