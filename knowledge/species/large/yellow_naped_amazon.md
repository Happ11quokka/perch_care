# Yellow-naped Amazon (*Amazona auropalliata*)

## Overview

The Yellow-naped Amazon is widely considered one of the finest talking parrots in the Amazon family. Native to the Pacific slope of Central America, from southern Mexico to Costa Rica, this intelligent and vocal species is prized for its remarkable speech clarity, musical ability, and strong personality. Yellow-naped Amazons form deep bonds with their owners and are known for their animated, expressive behavior. However, they can also be challenging to manage due to loud vocalizations and hormonal aggression during breeding season. Their conservation status is Vulnerable, making responsible ownership and captive breeding programs increasingly important.

## Appearance

The Yellow-naped Amazon is a robust, medium-to-large parrot with predominantly bright green plumage. The defining feature is the distinctive yellow patch on the nape (back of the neck), which gives the species its common name. This yellow nape patch is not present in very young birds -- it develops and expands progressively with age, typically becoming visible at around 1-2 years and continuing to grow over several years. Some mature individuals develop extensive yellow coloring that may extend from the nape toward the crown.

The beak is dark grey to black, and the eyes are orange with a pale grey eye ring. The flight feathers show blue and red accents visible when the wings are spread. The feet are grey. Overall, the Yellow-naped Amazon has a stocky, powerful build typical of the Amazon genus.

### Color Mutations

Color mutations are rare in Yellow-naped Amazons. Occasional lutino (yellow) specimens have been documented, but these are extremely uncommon in captivity.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Outstanding. The Yellow-naped Amazon is frequently ranked among the best talkers of all Amazon species and parrots in general. They develop large vocabularies, speak with exceptional clarity, and many individuals are talented singers who can learn and reproduce entire songs.
- **Noise Level**: High to very high. Yellow-naped Amazons are vocal birds with powerful voices. They engage in loud calling sessions, particularly at dawn and dusk. Their volume is substantial and can be disruptive in noise-sensitive living situations.
- **Temperament**: Bold, confident, and highly expressive. They are entertaining companions that enjoy attention and interaction. However, they can be quite aggressive during hormonal periods (breeding season), during which biting and territorial behavior are common. This species requires an experienced owner who can manage hormonal fluctuations with patience and consistency.
- **Social Needs**: Very high. Yellow-naped Amazons crave attention and social interaction. They can become destructive, loud, or develop behavioral problems if neglected or under-stimulated.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 36" x 24" x 48" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch to 1 inch
- Yellow-naped Amazons are strong, active birds that need a sturdy, spacious cage.
- Provide heavy-duty stainless steel or powder-coated cages, as they are powerful chewers.
- Multiple perches of varying diameters and materials (natural wood branches are ideal).
- A play area or play stand outside the cage is strongly recommended for daily out-of-cage time.

### Diet

- **Pellets**: 75-80% of the diet should be high-quality formulated pellets.
- **Fresh Produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables and limited fruit (peppers, broccoli, dark leafy greens, squash, green beans, carrots).
- **Fat Management**: Like all Amazons, Yellow-naped Amazons are prone to obesity. Strictly limit seeds, nuts, and high-fat foods.
- **Vitamin A**: Ensure adequate dietary vitamin A through orange and dark green vegetables (sweet potato, carrots, kale, spinach).
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, excessive fruit (sugar), and seed-only diets.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- Provide a minimum of 3-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- Yellow-naped Amazons are physically active and benefit greatly from climbing structures, swings, and play gyms.
- Provide a variety of destructible toys (wood blocks, cardboard, leather strips) to satisfy their chewing instinct.
- Foraging opportunities and puzzle toys provide essential mental stimulation.
- Regular training sessions reinforce positive behaviors and strengthen the bond between bird and owner.
- Bathing should be offered regularly through misting, a shower perch, or a shallow dish.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Obesity** | A primary health concern for all Amazon species. Yellow-naped Amazons have hearty appetites and gain weight easily on high-fat diets with insufficient exercise. |
| **Respiratory Infections** | Susceptible to bacterial and fungal respiratory infections. Signs include nasal discharge, sneezing, labored breathing, and tail bobbing. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Common on seed-based diets. Leads to respiratory problems, poor immune function, and skin/feather issues. |
| **Polyomavirus** | Viral disease affecting primarily young birds. Can cause sudden death in chicks and fledglings. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease** | Secondary to obesity. Causes lethargy, poor feather quality, and metabolic dysfunction. |
| **Hormonal Behavioral Issues** | While not a disease, hormonal aggression is a significant management concern. Seasonal behavior changes can be intense and long-lasting. |

## Breeding Information

Yellow-naped Amazons reach sexual maturity at approximately 4-6 years of age. In the wild, they nest in tree cavities, typically in large, old-growth trees. In captivity, breeding pairs require a spacious aviary and a large, sturdy nest box (approximately 12" x 12" x 24"). The typical clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an incubation period of approximately 26-28 days. The female incubates while the male provisions her. Chicks fledge at around 8-12 weeks.

Given the species' Vulnerable conservation status due to habitat loss and trapping for the pet trade, captive breeding should be conducted responsibly and ideally in coordination with conservation programs. Prospective owners should always seek captive-bred birds from reputable breeders rather than wild-caught individuals.
