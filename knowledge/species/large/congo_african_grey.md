# Congo African Grey (*Psittacus erithacus*)

## Overview

The Congo African Grey is widely regarded as the most intelligent parrot species in the world. Renowned for exceptional cognitive abilities and an unmatched capacity for speech, these parrots can develop vocabularies exceeding 1,000 words and demonstrate contextual understanding of language. Originally hailing from the dense forests of West and Central Africa, the Congo African Grey has become one of the most sought-after companion parrots globally. Their intelligence, however, comes with significant care demands -- they require extensive social interaction and mental stimulation to thrive and are prone to behavioral issues such as feather plucking when their needs are not met.

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Psittacidae |
| **Scientific Name** | *Psittacus erithacus* |
| **Origin** | West and Central Africa (Congo Basin, Ghana, Kenya) |
| **Size** | 33-40 cm (13-16 inches) |
| **Weight** | 350-650 g (typical 400-450 g) |
| **Lifespan** | 40-60 years in captivity |
| **Conservation Status** | Endangered (CITES Appendix I) |

## Appearance

The Congo African Grey has a striking silver-grey plumage that covers the majority of its body. The feathers are slightly lighter around the eyes and rump area, creating a subtle gradient effect. The most distinctive feature is the bright red tail, which contrasts sharply with the grey body. A prominent white mask of bare skin surrounds the eyes, giving the bird an expressive and intelligent appearance. The beak is solid black and strong, well-suited for cracking nuts and seeds. Juveniles have darker grey irises that lighten to a pale yellow as they mature.

There are no widely established color mutations in Congo African Greys, though occasional partial or incomplete melanin variants have been documented, producing birds with scattered red feathers throughout the body. These are extremely rare and not selectively bred in responsible aviculture.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Exceptional -- considered the best talker among all parrot species. Capable of learning 1,000+ words with clear pronunciation and contextual usage. Many individuals mimic household sounds, other pets, and electronic devices with remarkable accuracy.
- **Noise Level**: Moderate. While not as loud as cockatoos or macaws, they can produce sharp whistles and calls. Generally considered one of the quieter large parrots.
- **Temperament**: Highly intelligent and sensitive. Congo African Greys tend to bond closely with one person and can become shy or phobic around strangers or in unfamiliar situations. They are prone to phobic behavior -- sudden fear reactions to new objects, changes in environment, or unfamiliar people. Routine and consistency are extremely important for their emotional well-being.
- **Social Needs**: Very high. These parrots require several hours of daily interaction and mental stimulation. Loneliness and boredom are primary triggers for behavioral problems, particularly feather plucking.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 36" x 24" x 48" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch to 1 inch
- The cage should be placed in a social area of the home where the bird can observe and interact with the family, but away from the kitchen (fumes from heated cookware are toxic to birds).
- Provide multiple perches of varying diameters and materials to promote foot health.
- Include a play stand or play top outside the cage for supervised out-of-cage time.

### Diet

- **Pellets**: 60-70% of the diet should consist of high-quality formulated pellets.
- **Fresh Produce**: 30-40% fresh fruits and vegetables daily (dark leafy greens, sweet potato, carrots, peppers, berries).
- **Calcium Supplementation**: Critical for this species. Congo African Greys are highly prone to hypocalcemia (calcium deficiency). Provide calcium-rich foods (broccoli, kale, almonds) and consider a veterinarian-recommended calcium supplement.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, high-fat seeds as a primary diet.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- A minimum of 3-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily is recommended.
- Provide a variety of foraging toys, puzzle feeders, and shreddable toys to keep their highly active minds engaged.
- Rotate toys regularly to prevent boredom.
- Training sessions using positive reinforcement are excellent for bonding and mental stimulation.
- African Greys are high powder-down producers; regular bathing or misting helps manage feather dust and promotes feather health.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hypocalcemia** | Very common in African Greys. Calcium deficiency can cause seizures, weakness, and bone deformities. Regular calcium supplementation and UV lighting or outdoor time for vitamin D3 synthesis are essential. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral disease causing abnormal feather growth, beak deformities, and immune suppression. No cure; supportive care only. |
| **Aspergillosis** | Fungal respiratory infection. African Greys are particularly susceptible. Maintain clean, well-ventilated living environments. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Common behavioral and medical issue. Can be triggered by stress, boredom, dietary deficiencies, or medical conditions. Requires thorough veterinary and behavioral evaluation. |
| **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)** | Viral disease affecting the nervous system and digestive tract. Causes weight loss, regurgitation, and undigested food in droppings. |
| **Respiratory Infections** | Susceptible to bacterial and fungal respiratory infections. Watch for nasal discharge, labored breathing, and tail bobbing. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Results from seed-heavy diets. Causes respiratory and skin problems. Prevented with a balanced diet rich in beta-carotene. |

## Breeding Information

Congo African Greys reach sexual maturity at approximately 3-5 years of age. In the wild, they nest in tree cavities high above the forest floor. In captivity, breeding pairs require a large, sturdy nest box (approximately 12" x 12" x 24") mounted high in the aviary. The typical clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an incubation period of approximately 28-30 days. The female incubates while the male feeds her. Chicks fledge at around 12-14 weeks. Breeding should only be undertaken by experienced aviculturists, as the species is endangered and responsible breeding practices are critical to conservation efforts.
