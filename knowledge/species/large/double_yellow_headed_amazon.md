# Double Yellow-headed Amazon (*Amazona oratrix*)

## Overview

The Double Yellow-headed Amazon is one of the most spectacular and dramatic members of the Amazon parrot family. Known for its stunning plumage -- with the entire head gradually turning brilliant yellow as the bird matures -- this species combines striking beauty with an outsized personality. They are excellent talkers and gifted singers, often performing with theatrical flair. However, the Double Yellow-headed Amazon is also among the most challenging Amazons to keep, due to intense hormonal aggression and strong-willed behavior. Their Endangered conservation status adds an important ethical dimension to ownership, and prospective keepers should only acquire captive-bred birds from reputable sources.

## Appearance

The Double Yellow-headed Amazon is a large, robust parrot with predominantly bright green body plumage. The species' most celebrated feature is the progressive yellowing of the head. Juvenile birds have yellow coloring limited to the forehead and crown, but with each successive molt, the yellow plumage extends further until, in mature adults (typically by 8-10 years of age), the entire head is a vivid, deep yellow. This gradual transformation is one of the most visually dramatic aging processes in the parrot world.

The wings display red and blue accents on the flight feathers, visible when the wings are extended. The beak is pale horn to yellowish, the eyes are orange, and the feet are grey-green. The overall build is stocky and powerful.

### Color Mutations

Color mutations in Double Yellow-headed Amazons are uncommon. The primary variation is in the subspecies:
- *A. oratrix oratrix*: The nominate form, with the most extensive yellow head coloring.
- *A. oratrix tresmariae*: Found on the Tres Marias Islands, slightly larger with more extensive yellow.
- *A. oratrix belizensis*: Belize population, sometimes with a less extensive yellow head.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Excellent. Double Yellow-headed Amazons are among the best talkers in the Amazon genus. They speak clearly and with expression, and many individuals are remarkable singers who can learn and perform songs, opera-like vocalizations, and complex sound sequences.
- **Noise Level**: High to very high. This is a loud species with powerful vocalizations, especially during morning and evening calling periods. Their vocal performances, while entertaining, can be disruptive.
- **Temperament**: Dramatic, bold, and attention-loving. Double Yellow-headed Amazons are theatrical birds that enjoy performing and being the center of attention. They are confident and interactive but can also be stubborn. Hormonal aggression is a significant and well-documented challenge with this species -- during breeding season, they can become unpredictably aggressive, biting hard and showing territorial behavior. This requires experienced handling and management strategies.
- **Social Needs**: Very high. They demand significant daily attention and interaction. Without adequate socialization, they can develop behavioral problems including excessive screaming, biting, and feather plucking.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 36" x 24" x 48" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch to 1 inch
- A heavy-duty, well-constructed cage is essential, as these birds are powerful chewers with strong beaks.
- Stainless steel cages are preferred for durability and safety.
- Multiple perches at varying heights and a play top or external play stand are recommended.
- The cage should be placed in a well-lit, socially active area of the home, away from kitchen fumes.

### Diet

- **Pellets**: 75-80% of the diet should be high-quality formulated pellets.
- **Fresh Produce**: 20-25% fresh vegetables with limited fruit (dark leafy greens, peppers, squash, broccoli, carrots, green beans).
- **Obesity Prevention**: This is critically important. Double Yellow-headed Amazons, like all Amazons, have a strong predisposition to obesity. Seeds and nuts should be offered only as occasional treats.
- **Vitamin A**: Ensure sufficient dietary vitamin A through orange and green vegetables.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, high-fat seed mixes as a primary diet, and excessive fruit.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- A minimum of 3-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily is essential.
- Provide a stimulating environment with climbing opportunities, swings, and ladders.
- Destructible toys (wood, cardboard, natural fiber) satisfy their strong chewing drive.
- Foraging toys and puzzle feeders engage their intelligence.
- Training sessions and trick learning provide mental stimulation and help manage behavioral issues.
- Regular bathing or misting supports feather health and is enjoyed by most individuals.
- During hormonal periods, limit daylight hours to 10-12 hours, remove nest-like enclosures, and avoid petting the bird on the back or under the wings, which can stimulate hormonal behavior.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Obesity** | The most significant health threat. Amazons are sedentary eaters that gain weight easily. Strict dietary management and regular exercise are essential. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)** | A direct consequence of obesity. Can lead to liver failure if not addressed through dietary changes. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Common when birds are fed seed-based diets. Causes respiratory infections, poor immune function, and mucous membrane changes. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Can occur due to stress, boredom, hormonal imbalances, or underlying medical conditions. Thorough veterinary evaluation is recommended. |
| **Hormonal Aggression** | While behavioral rather than medical, hormonal cycles cause significant management challenges and can result in injuries to owners. Environmental management is key. |

## Breeding Information

Double Yellow-headed Amazons reach sexual maturity at approximately 4-6 years of age. In the wild, they nest in natural tree cavities in tropical and subtropical forests. In captivity, breeding pairs require a large, secure aviary and a robust nest box (approximately 12" x 12" x 24"). The typical clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an incubation period of approximately 26-28 days. Chicks fledge at around 8-10 weeks.

Given the Endangered conservation status of this species -- driven primarily by habitat destruction and illegal trapping for the pet trade -- responsible captive breeding is of significant conservation value. Breeding programs should prioritize genetic diversity and collaborate with conservation organizations. All prospective owners should verify that birds are legally captive-bred and properly documented.
