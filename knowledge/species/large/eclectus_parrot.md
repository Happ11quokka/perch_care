# Eclectus Parrot (*Eclectus roratus*)

## Overview

The Eclectus Parrot is one of the most visually extraordinary parrot species in the world, exhibiting the most extreme sexual dimorphism of any parrot -- males and females look so dramatically different that they were originally classified as separate species. Beyond their stunning appearance, Eclectus Parrots are distinguished by a unique digestive system that sets their dietary requirements apart from many other companion parrots. Their longer digestive tract may increase sensitivity to dietary excess in some individuals, so diet formulation should be conservative and individualized with avian-veterinary guidance.

## Basic Information

## Appearance

The Eclectus Parrot displays the most pronounced sexual dimorphism of any parrot species, to the point that early ornithologists classified the male and female as entirely separate species.

### Males
Males are a brilliant emerald green over the entire body, with bright blue primary flight feathers and vivid red flanks visible under the wings. The beak is a striking candy corn coloration -- the upper mandible is coral/orange transitioning to a yellow tip. The overall appearance is sleek and iridescent, with a hair-like feather texture unique to the species.

### Females
Females are a dramatic deep red over the head, chest, and back, transitioning to a rich royal purple or blue-violet on the belly, lower breast, and nape. The beak is entirely black. Females are arguably even more visually striking than males, with their red and purple plumage creating a bold, unmistakable appearance.

### Color Mutations

Several subspecies exhibit slight variations in coloring:
- *E. r. roratus* (Grand Eclectus): The nominate form from the Moluccas.
- *E. r. vosmaeri* (Vosmaeri Eclectus): Larger, with brighter and more extensive red and purple in females.
- *E. r. solomonensis* (Solomon Island Eclectus): The most commonly kept subspecies; smaller with a brighter green in males.
- *E. r. polychloros* (Red-sided Eclectus): From New Guinea; females have a blue eye ring.

True captive color mutations are extremely rare in Eclectus parrots.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Good to excellent. Eclectus parrots can develop clear vocabularies and often speak in a distinct, melodic tone. Males are generally considered more talkative than females, though individual variation is significant.
- **Noise Level**: Moderate. Eclectus parrots are generally quieter than Amazons, cockatoos, and macaws. They can produce loud calls but are not typically noisy throughout the day. Females may be more vocal and can develop a honking call.
- **Temperament**: Calm, gentle, and somewhat reserved compared to other large parrots. Eclectus parrots are often described as dignified and observant. Males tend to be more easygoing and affable, while females can be more assertive, territorial (especially around perceived nesting sites), and independent. Both sexes are intelligent and can be trained effectively with positive reinforcement.
- **Social Needs**: Moderate to high. They enjoy interaction but are less demanding of constant attention than African Greys or Amazons. They can be more content entertaining themselves with toys and foraging activities, though daily socialization remains important.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 36" x 24" x 48" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch to 1 inch
- Eclectus parrots benefit from spacious cages with room to spread their wings and climb.
- Natural wood perches of varying diameters are preferred.
- Provide multiple foraging stations and feeding areas, as their dietary routine often involves fresh foods that need frequent replacement.
- Placement in a calm, well-lit area is ideal; Eclectus parrots can be sensitive to chaotic or overly noisy environments.

### Diet

**Important: Eclectus parrots generally do best on a fresh-food-forward diet, with pellets used as a supplement rather than the sole base.**

- **Fresh Foods**: About 60-70% of the diet (vegetables, fruits, leafy greens, sprouts) is commonly recommended.
  - Vegetables: dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, dandelion greens), carrots, sweet potato, broccoli, corn, peas, peppers, green beans.
  - Fruits: papaya, mango, pomegranate, berries, melon, figs (in moderation due to sugar content).
  - Sprouts and legumes: sprouted mung beans, lentils, chickpeas.
- **Pellets**: About 20-30% of the diet, preferably high-quality pellets without artificial dyes and excessive fortification.
- **Practical Caution**: Avoid heavily colored or aggressively fortified products; some Eclectus owners and clinicians report diet-linked toe-tapping/wing-flipping, but causality is still debated. Synthetic supplementation should be veterinarian-directed.
- **Strictly Avoid**: Processed human foods, avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and high-salt/high-sugar foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- Provide 2-3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- Eclectus parrots enjoy climbing, swinging, and playing with foot toys.
- Foraging is particularly important for this species -- hide fresh foods in foraging toys and create opportunities for natural food-seeking behavior.
- Bathing is well-received and important for maintaining their unique feather texture. Regular misting or access to a shallow bath is recommended.
- Their calm temperament makes them well-suited for positive reinforcement training sessions.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hypervitaminosis** | Nutrient excess can occur when fortified pellets and synthetic supplements are layered on top of each other. Monitor diet and supplements with an avian veterinarian. |
| **Toe-Tapping and Wing-Flipping** | Repetitive toe-tapping and/or involuntary wing-flipping are reported in Eclectus parrots. Dietary triggers are frequently suspected, but high-quality causal evidence is limited; a structured diet trial with veterinary oversight is recommended. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Can occur due to dietary deficiency or imbalance, stress, hormonal changes, or medical conditions. Dietary evaluation should be the first step in diagnosis. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Despite the need to avoid synthetic vitamins, natural vitamin A from whole foods remains essential. Inadequate fresh produce intake can lead to deficiency. |
| **Fatty Liver Disease** | Can occur from high-fat diets, particularly seed-heavy feeding. Less common when birds are maintained on a proper fresh-food-based diet. |
| **Candidiasis** | Fungal infection of the digestive tract, sometimes related to dietary imbalances or antibiotic use. |

## Breeding Information

Eclectus parrots reach sexual maturity at approximately 2-3 years of age. In the wild, they have an unusual cooperative breeding system: females remain in and fiercely defend tree-cavity nests while multiple males may contribute to feeding a single nesting female. This unique social structure influences captive behavior, with females showing strong nesting instincts and territorial behavior around enclosed spaces.

In captivity, breeding pairs require a large nest box (approximately 12" x 12" x 24" vertical box) or a natural log nest. The typical clutch size is 2 eggs, with an incubation period of approximately 26-28 days. The female incubates while the male (and in the wild, potentially other males) provisions her. Chicks fledge at approximately 11-12 weeks. Females can become highly aggressive in defense of their nest, and caution is advised during breeding periods.
