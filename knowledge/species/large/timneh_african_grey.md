# Timneh African Grey (*Psittacus timneh*)

## Overview

The Timneh African Grey is the smaller and often overlooked cousin of the Congo African Grey. Formerly classified as a subspecies, the Timneh is now recognized as a distinct species. While sharing many of the Congo's remarkable cognitive and vocal abilities, the Timneh is often described as having a more stable and easygoing temperament, making it an excellent choice for first-time large parrot owners. They tend to learn to speak earlier than Congos, sometimes beginning as young as six months of age, and are generally less prone to the phobic behaviors and feather plucking that plague their larger relatives.

## Basic Information

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Family** | Psittacidae |
| **Scientific Name** | *Psittacus timneh* |
| **Origin** | West Africa (Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia) |
| **Size** | 23-28 cm (9-11 inches) |
| **Weight** | 250-375 g |
| **Lifespan** | 40-60 years in captivity |
| **Conservation Status** | Endangered (IUCN Red List); CITES Appendix I |

## Appearance

The Timneh African Grey is noticeably smaller and darker than the Congo African Grey. The body plumage is a darker charcoal grey, giving the bird a more subdued appearance overall. The most reliable visual distinction from the Congo is the tail color: the Timneh sports a maroon or dark burgundy tail rather than the Congo's bright red. Another key identifier is the beak -- the upper mandible is horn-colored (light beige to pinkish) with a dark edge along the tip, in contrast to the Congo's solid black beak. The bare facial skin patch around the eyes is similar in shape but smaller. Juveniles are nearly identical to adults but may have slightly darker irises that lighten with age.

## Temperament & Personality

- **Talking Ability**: Excellent. Timnehs are skilled talkers with clear pronunciation, though their vocabulary may be somewhat smaller than a Congo's. They often begin talking at around 6 months of age, significantly earlier than the Congo (which typically starts around 12 months).
- **Noise Level**: Quiet to moderate. The Timneh is generally quieter than the Congo African Grey and considerably quieter than Amazon parrots or cockatoos. This makes them better suited for apartment living.
- **Temperament**: More adaptable and less neurotic than the Congo. Timnehs tend to adjust more readily to new environments, people, and situations. They are less likely to develop phobic behaviors and are generally described as more laid-back and confident. They still bond deeply with their owners but are less likely to become one-person birds.
- **Social Needs**: High, though slightly less demanding than the Congo. They still require daily interaction and mental stimulation but tend to handle periods of solitude somewhat better.
- **First-Time Owner Suitability**: Often recommended as the better choice for first-time large parrot owners due to their more stable temperament and hardier disposition.

## Care Requirements

### Housing

- **Minimum Cage Size**: 34" x 24" x 36" (width x depth x height)
- **Bar Spacing**: 3/4 inch to 1 inch
- Despite their smaller size, Timnehs are active birds that benefit from as large a cage as possible.
- Placement in a family-oriented room is ideal, as they enjoy being part of household activities.
- Multiple perches of varying diameters and textures support foot health.

### Diet

- **Pellets**: 60-70% of the diet should be high-quality formulated pellets.
- **Fresh Produce**: 30-40% fresh fruits and vegetables (dark leafy greens, orange and red vegetables, berries, peppers).
- **Calcium Supplementation**: Like Congos, Timnehs are susceptible to calcium deficiency. Provide calcium-rich foods and consider supplementation under veterinary guidance.
- **Seeds and Nuts**: Offer sparingly as treats -- no more than 10% of the total diet.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and high-fat or high-sodium processed foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment

- Provide 2-3 hours minimum of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- Foraging toys and puzzle feeders are essential for mental stimulation.
- Timnehs enjoy foot toys and manipulating objects with their feet and beak.
- Regular bathing or misting is recommended -- Timnehs, like Congos, are powder-down producers.
- Training sessions using positive reinforcement strengthen the bond and provide cognitive exercise.

## Common Health Issues

| Condition | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Hypocalcemia** | Calcium deficiency is a significant concern, as with all African Greys. Provide UV lighting or supervised outdoor time for vitamin D3 synthesis, along with dietary calcium. |
| **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)** | Viral condition causing feather abnormalities and immune suppression. |
| **Aspergillosis** | Fungal respiratory infection; maintain clean, well-ventilated environments. |
| **Feather Plucking** | Less common than in Congos, but still possible due to stress, boredom, or medical causes. |
| **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)** | Neurological/gastrointestinal viral disease. |
| **Respiratory Infections** | Monitor for nasal discharge, wheezing, and tail bobbing. |
| **Vitamin A Deficiency** | Prevented through a balanced diet with adequate fresh vegetables. |

Overall, the Timneh African Grey is considered generally hardier and slightly more resilient than the Congo African Grey, with a somewhat lower incidence of stress-related health issues.

## Breeding Information

Timneh African Greys reach sexual maturity at approximately 3-5 years of age. Breeding pairs require a spacious aviary and a secure nest box (approximately 10" x 10" x 20") mounted at a height that provides the birds with a sense of security. The typical clutch size is 2-4 eggs, with an incubation period of around 28 days. The female primarily incubates while the male provides food. Chicks fledge at approximately 12 weeks. Due to their endangered status, captive breeding should only be undertaken by experienced and responsible aviculturists in coordination with conservation programs.
