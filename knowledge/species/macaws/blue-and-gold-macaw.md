# Blue-and-Gold Macaw (*Ara ararauna*)

## Overview
The Blue-and-Gold Macaw is one of the most recognizable and popular large parrot species kept as companion birds. Known for their striking blue and yellow plumage, high intelligence, and sociable personality, they have been kept as pets for centuries. They are widely regarded as one of the best macaw species for experienced bird owners due to their trainability and affectionate nature.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Central and South America, ranging from Panama south through Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. Found in tropical forests, woodlands, and swampy areas near rivers.
- **Size**: 76–86 cm (30–34 inches) from head to tail tip
- **Weight**: 900–1,200 grams (approximately 2–2.6 lbs)
- **Lifespan**: 50–60+ years in captivity with proper care; some individuals have been reported to live beyond 70 years

## Appearance
Blue-and-Gold Macaws have a vivid turquoise-blue plumage on the upperparts (back, wings, and tail) and a rich golden-yellow on the underparts (chest and belly). The forehead is green, transitioning into the blue of the crown and nape. The face is bare white skin adorned with small lines of black feathers, which are unique to each individual — essentially a facial fingerprint. The large, powerful beak is black, and the eyes are pale yellow with a dark pupil. Juveniles resemble adults but have darker eyes that lighten with age. There are no common color mutations in this species in aviculture.

## Temperament & Personality
Blue-and-Gold Macaws are highly intelligent, social, and affectionate birds. They bond strongly with their owners and thrive on interaction and attention. They are among the better talkers of the macaw family, capable of learning a vocabulary of around 20 or more words and phrases, though clarity varies by individual. They are also skilled at mimicking sounds and tones.

Their noise level is considerable; they are loud birds with powerful vocalizations that can carry over long distances. They typically vocalize most at dawn and dusk. This is normal flock-calling behavior and should be expected.

When well-socialized, they are generally gentle and playful. However, they can become nippy or develop behavioral issues (such as feather plucking or screaming) if they do not receive adequate socialization, mental stimulation, and exercise. They are known for their clownish antics and enjoy performing tricks.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A Blue-and-Gold Macaw requires a very large cage — a minimum of 91 cm x 91 cm x 152 cm (36 x 36 x 60 inches), though larger is always better. Bar spacing should be 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 inches) to prevent the bird from getting its head stuck. The cage should be constructed of strong stainless steel or powder-coated metal, as macaws can bend or break weaker materials with their powerful beaks.

The cage should include multiple perches of varying diameters and textures (natural wood branches are ideal), stainless steel food and water bowls, and a variety of toys. A playstand or play gym outside the cage is highly recommended for daily out-of-cage time. The cage should be placed in a well-lit, draft-free area where the bird can interact with the family.

### Diet
A balanced diet should consist of:
- **High-quality pelleted diet**: Should make up approximately 60–70% of the diet. Brands formulated for large macaws are recommended.
- **Fresh fruits and vegetables**: 20–30% of the diet. Offer a variety including leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard), carrots, sweet potatoes, peppers, broccoli, apples, bananas, berries, grapes, and mango.
- **Nuts and seeds**: Offered in moderation as treats (approximately 5–10%). Macadamia nuts, walnuts, almonds, and Brazil nuts are favorites. These are high in fat and should not be overfed.
- **Fresh water**: Must be available at all times and changed daily.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, fruit pits/seeds (apple, cherry, etc.), onion, garlic, and high-salt or high-sugar processed foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Blue-and-Gold Macaws are active birds that require a minimum of 2–3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily. They need both physical exercise (climbing, flying in safe spaces) and mental stimulation. Enrichment should include:
- Foraging toys that require problem-solving to access food
- Destructible toys made of wood, leather, and natural fibers
- Puzzle toys and training sessions (trick training provides excellent mental exercise)
- Social interaction with family members
- Rotating toys regularly to prevent boredom

## Common Health Issues
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Also known as macaw wasting disease, this is a viral condition (caused by avian bornavirus) that affects the nerves of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to poor digestion, weight loss, and regurgitation.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci* that can cause respiratory signs, lethargy, and eye discharge. It is zoonotic (transmissible to humans).
- **Feather Destructive Behavior (Feather Plucking)**: Often related to stress, boredom, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying medical conditions. It is one of the most common behavioral/medical issues in captive macaws.
- **Macaw Respiratory Hypersensitivity**: Some macaws can develop respiratory issues from exposure to powder down (from cockatoos or African Greys), aerosols, and scented products.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A viral disease caused by a circovirus that affects the beak, feathers, and immune system.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection caused by *Aspergillus* species, often associated with poor ventilation, stress, or immunosuppression.
- **Atherosclerosis**: Hardening of the arteries, particularly common in older macaws fed high-fat diets.
- **Vitamin A Deficiency**: Common in birds fed all-seed diets, leading to changes in the mucous membranes and increased susceptibility to infections.

## Breeding Information
Blue-and-Gold Macaws reach sexual maturity at approximately 3–6 years of age. In the wild, they typically nest in tree cavities high above the ground. In captivity, they require a large nesting box approximately 61 cm x 61 cm x 91 cm (24 x 24 x 36 inches) with an entrance hole of about 15 cm (6 inches) in diameter.

The typical clutch size is 2–3 eggs, which are incubated primarily by the female for approximately 24–28 days. Chicks fledge at around 90–100 days but remain dependent on the parents for several months after fledging. Breeding pairs require a strong bond and a spacious, quiet environment. They generally breed once per year.
