# Green-winged Macaw (*Ara chloropterus*)

## Overview
The Green-winged Macaw, also known as the Red-and-Green Macaw, is the second-largest macaw species (after the Hyacinth Macaw) and one of the largest parrots in the world. Often confused with the Scarlet Macaw due to their similar red plumage, the Green-winged Macaw is distinguished by its green (rather than yellow) wing band and red lines of feathers on the bare facial patch. Widely considered one of the "gentle giants" of the parrot world, Green-winged Macaws are prized for their calm, affectionate temperament, making them one of the more manageable large macaw species for experienced aviculturists.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Central and South America, from southern Panama through Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. They inhabit tropical and subtropical forests, often at higher elevations than Scarlet Macaws.
- **Size**: 90–95 cm (35–37 inches) from head to tail tip
- **Weight**: 1,050–1,700 grams (approximately 2.3–3.7 lbs), typically around 1,200–1,400 grams
- **Lifespan**: 50–60+ years in captivity; some individuals have been reported living into their 70s and 80s

## Appearance
The Green-winged Macaw is predominantly deep crimson red on the head, neck, chest, and upper body. The key distinguishing feature from the Scarlet Macaw is the wing coloration: the upper wing coverts are green (not yellow as in the Scarlet), transitioning to dark blue on the flight feathers and lower wing. The lower back and rump are pale blue. The tail is long, with red and blue feathers.

The face has a large patch of bare white skin with distinctive lines of small red feathers arranged in unique patterns — these feather lines are more prominent and noticeable than those of the Blue-and-Gold Macaw. The upper mandible is horn-colored with a dark tip, and the lower mandible is dark grey to black. Eyes are pale yellow in adults. The Green-winged Macaw has a noticeably larger head and beak than the Scarlet Macaw, contributing to its more robust appearance.

## Temperament & Personality
Green-winged Macaws are widely regarded as one of the most even-tempered and gentle large macaw species. They tend to be calmer and less nippy than Scarlet Macaws, and while they can be as affectionate as Blue-and-Gold Macaws, they are often described as more dignified and laid-back.

They are moderately good talkers, capable of learning a vocabulary of words and phrases, though individual ability varies. They are more noted for their gentle demeanor and desire for physical affection (cuddling, head scratching) than for their talking prowess.

Noise level is high, as with all large macaws, but Green-winged Macaws are often considered slightly quieter overall than Scarlet or Blue-and-Gold Macaws. They still possess powerful vocalizations and will call loudly, particularly at dawn and dusk.

They bond strongly with their owners and can become very attached. They generally get along well with other birds and family members when properly socialized but can become possessive of their preferred person if not encouraged to interact with multiple people.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Given their very large size, Green-winged Macaws require the largest cages available. The minimum recommended cage size is 91 cm x 91 cm x 152 cm (36 x 36 x 60 inches), but an enclosure of 122 cm x 91 cm x 183 cm (48 x 36 x 72 inches) or larger is strongly preferred. Bar spacing should be 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 inches), and the cage must be extremely sturdy (heavy-gauge stainless steel is ideal) as their beak is exceptionally powerful.

A large play gym or T-stand outside the cage is essential for daily out-of-cage time. The cage should include multiple natural wood perches of varying diameters (the largest perches should require the bird to open its foot fully to grip), stainless steel bowls, and an assortment of durable toys. Due to their size, a dedicated bird room or walk-in aviary is the optimal housing arrangement.

### Diet
A balanced diet should include:
- **High-quality pelleted diet**: 60–70% of the daily diet. Pellets formulated for large macaws provide the best nutritional foundation.
- **Fresh fruits and vegetables**: 20–30% of the diet. Offer a diverse selection including dark leafy greens (kale, collard greens, Swiss chard), broccoli, carrots, sweet potatoes, bell peppers, corn on the cob, apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, papayas, and pomegranates.
- **Nuts**: Offered in moderation as treats. Green-winged Macaws have exceptionally strong beaks and can crack the hardest nuts, including Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds. Due to the high fat content, these should be limited.
- **Cooked grains and legumes**: Brown rice, quinoa, cooked beans, and lentils can supplement the diet.
- **Fresh water**: Available at all times and changed daily.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, fruit seeds/pits, and salty or sugary processed foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Green-winged Macaws need a minimum of 2–3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily. Despite their calm demeanor, they are physically active and need opportunities to climb, explore, and exercise their wings. Enrichment should include:
- Extra-large, heavy-duty chew toys designed for large macaws (they can destroy toys meant for smaller species in minutes)
- Foraging toys and activities to stimulate natural feeding behavior
- Social interaction and physical affection from family members
- Training sessions (they respond well to positive reinforcement and enjoy learning tricks)
- Swings, ladders, and climbing structures
- Bathing opportunities through misting or a shallow shower perch
- Supervised outdoor time in a secure aviary for natural sunlight exposure

## Common Health Issues
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: This viral disease (avian bornavirus) is a significant concern in all large macaw species. It affects the nerves of the gastrointestinal tract, causing poor motility, weight loss, and undigested food in droppings.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circoviral disease affecting feather quality, beak integrity, and immune function. Young birds are most susceptible.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal infection of the respiratory tract caused by *Aspergillus* species. Stress, poor ventilation, and immunosuppression increase susceptibility.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*, producing respiratory signs and lethargy. Zoonotic risk to humans.
- **Feather Destructive Behavior**: While less common in Green-winged Macaws than in some other species, feather plucking can occur due to stress, boredom, hormonal changes, or medical issues.
- **Atherosclerosis**: Progressive build-up of fatty deposits in arterial walls, particularly in birds fed high-fat diets over many years.
- **Papillomatosis**: Macaws are prone to developing papillomas (benign growths) in the oral cavity, cloaca, and bile ducts, caused by a herpesvirus.
- **Obesity**: Due to their large size and often sedentary captive lifestyle, Green-winged Macaws can be prone to weight gain, particularly when offered excessive nuts and seeds.
- **Constricted Toe Syndrome**: A condition seen in chicks where fibers or dried tissue constrict blood flow to the toes, potentially causing toe loss if not addressed promptly.

## Breeding Information
Green-winged Macaws typically reach sexual maturity at approximately 4–6 years of age, later than some smaller macaw species. In the wild, they nest in large tree cavities or cliff faces. In captivity, they require a very large, sturdy nesting box — approximately 61 cm x 61 cm x 122 cm (24 x 24 x 48 inches) — given their large body size.

The typical clutch size is 2–3 eggs. Incubation is performed primarily by the female and lasts approximately 26–28 days. Chicks are relatively slow to develop; they fledge at around 90–100 days and may remain dependent on the parents for several months afterward. Green-winged Macaws typically breed once per year, and pairs may not breed every year. Captive breeding can be challenging, as pairs require a strong bond, ample space, and minimal disturbance.
