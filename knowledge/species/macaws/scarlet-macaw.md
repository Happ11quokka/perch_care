# Scarlet Macaw (*Ara macao*)

## Overview
The Scarlet Macaw is one of the most visually stunning parrots in the world, renowned for its brilliant red, yellow, and blue plumage. Native to the humid tropical forests of Central and South America, this large macaw has been a symbol of the neotropics for centuries. While breathtaking in appearance, Scarlet Macaws are considered more challenging companion birds than some other macaw species due to their higher tendency toward nervousness and nippy behavior if not extensively socialized from a young age.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Southern Mexico through Central America and into South America, including Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil. They inhabit humid lowland tropical forests, often near rivers.
- **Size**: 81–96 cm (32–38 inches) from head to tail tip, making them one of the larger macaw species
- **Weight**: 900–1,100 grams (approximately 2–2.4 lbs)
- **Lifespan**: 40–50 years in captivity; some individuals may live 60+ years with excellent care

## Appearance
The Scarlet Macaw is predominantly brilliant red across the head, body, and upper tail. The wings display a striking pattern: red on the upper wing coverts, followed by a band of yellow on the middle wing coverts, and then blue on the flight feathers and lower wing. The upper tail is red and blue, while the undertail coverts are light blue. The face has a large patch of bare white skin extending from the eye to the upper mandible, with tiny rows of red feathers crossing it. The upper mandible is horn-colored (pale) with a dark base, and the lower mandible is black. Eyes are pale yellow in adults and dark in juveniles.

Two subspecies are recognized: *Ara macao macao* (South American, with a wider band of yellow on the wing) and *Ara macao cyanopterus* (Central American, larger with a narrower yellow band, sometimes showing green in the yellow area).

## Temperament & Personality
Scarlet Macaws are intelligent and energetic birds with bold personalities. They tend to be more high-strung and temperamental compared to Blue-and-Gold or Green-winged Macaws. They can be nippy, particularly during adolescence and sexual maturity, and may have a preference for one person in the household.

Their talking ability is moderate; they can learn some words and phrases but are generally not as proficient at speech as Blue-and-Gold Macaws. They are, however, very expressive and communicate through body language and vocalizations.

Noise level is very high. Scarlet Macaws are among the louder macaw species, with piercing screams that can be challenging in residential settings. Consistent socialization, positive reinforcement training, and adequate stimulation from an early age are essential to raising a well-adjusted Scarlet Macaw.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A very large, sturdy cage is essential — minimum dimensions of 91 cm x 61 cm x 152 cm (36 x 24 x 60 inches), though larger is strongly preferred. A walk-in aviary or dedicated bird room is ideal for this active species. Bar spacing should be 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 inches). The cage must be constructed from heavy-gauge stainless steel or reinforced powder-coated metal, as Scarlet Macaws are powerful chewers.

Provide multiple perches of varying diameters and materials (natural wood branches such as manzanita, java wood, or untreated fruit tree branches), foraging stations, and a variety of toys. A secure outdoor aviary for supervised sun exposure (with shade available) is beneficial.

### Diet
A nutritionally complete diet should include:
- **High-quality pelleted diet**: Approximately 60–70% of the daily intake. Formulations designed for large macaws are ideal.
- **Fresh fruits and vegetables**: 20–30% of the diet. Include dark leafy greens, carrots, bell peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, mangoes, papayas, berries, pomegranates, and grapes.
- **Nuts**: Offered sparingly as treats or training rewards. Scarlet Macaws in the wild consume palm nuts and other high-fat seeds; in captivity, offer walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, and macadamia nuts in moderation.
- **Sprouted seeds and legumes**: Can be offered as a nutritious supplement.
- **Fresh water**: Changed daily.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, fruit pits, and processed foods.

In the wild, Scarlet Macaws have been observed eating clay from riverbank clay licks (known as "colpas"), which is believed to help neutralize toxins in their diet. Some keepers offer mineral blocks as a captive substitute.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Scarlet Macaws are highly active and require a minimum of 2–3 hours of out-of-cage time daily in a bird-safe environment. They are strong fliers and benefit from opportunities for flight when space allows. Enrichment should include:
- Heavy-duty chew toys (hardwood blocks, leather strips, thick rope toys)
- Foraging opportunities that encourage natural food-seeking behavior
- Interactive play sessions with their owner
- Trick training using positive reinforcement
- Puzzle feeders and destructible toys rotated frequently to prevent boredom
- Bathing opportunities (misting or shallow water dish)

## Common Health Issues
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A serious viral disease (avian bornavirus) affecting the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system. Signs include weight loss, undigested food in droppings, and regurgitation.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circoviral disease that causes feather abnormalities, beak lesions, and immunosuppression.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A zoonotic bacterial infection causing respiratory signs, lethargy, and lime-green droppings.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection particularly dangerous for immunocompromised or stressed birds.
- **Feather Destructive Behavior**: Scarlet Macaws can be prone to feather plucking, often triggered by stress, lack of socialization, boredom, or environmental changes.
- **Papillomatosis**: Viral condition causing papillomas (wart-like growths) in the oral cavity, cloaca, or bile ducts. Macaws are particularly susceptible.
- **Atherosclerosis**: Fatty deposits in the arteries, common in older birds or those on high-fat diets.
- **Vitamin A Deficiency (Hypovitaminosis A)**: Particularly in birds fed seed-based diets lacking in beta-carotene-rich vegetables.

## Breeding Information
Scarlet Macaws reach sexual maturity at approximately 3–5 years of age. In the wild, they nest in large tree cavities, often in emergent trees. In captivity, a sturdy nesting box measuring approximately 61 cm x 61 cm x 91 cm (24 x 24 x 36 inches) should be provided.

The typical clutch size is 2–4 eggs (usually 2–3). Incubation is performed primarily by the female and lasts approximately 24–26 days. Chicks fledge at around 90–105 days but remain with the parents for 1–2 years in the wild, which contributes to the species' typically slow reproductive rate of breeding only every 1–2 years.
