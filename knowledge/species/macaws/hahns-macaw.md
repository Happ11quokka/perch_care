# Hahn's Macaw (*Diopsittaca nobilis*)

## Overview
The Hahn's Macaw is the smallest of all macaw species and is a subspecies of the Red-shouldered Macaw (also known as the Noble Macaw). Despite their diminutive size relative to other macaws, Hahn's Macaws possess all of the personality, intelligence, and charm of their larger cousins in a more manageable package. They are excellent companion birds for those who want the macaw experience without the extreme space and noise requirements of large macaws. They are often recommended as a good "first macaw" for bird enthusiasts.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Northern South America, including Venezuela, the Guianas, Brazil (particularly the northern and eastern regions), and parts of Bolivia. They inhabit savannas, open woodlands, swamplands, and forest edges, often in palm groves.
- **Size**: 30–35 cm (12–14 inches) from head to tail tip
- **Weight**: 130–170 grams (approximately 4.6–6 ounces)
- **Lifespan**: 20–30 years in captivity with proper care; some individuals may live longer

## Appearance
The Hahn's Macaw is predominantly green, with darker green on the upperparts and lighter, more yellowish-green on the underparts. The forehead and crown are dark blue to blue-black. The bend of the wing (shoulder area) displays a patch of red, which gives the species its alternate common name, Red-shouldered Macaw. The undersides of the wing and tail feathers show a yellowish-olive coloration. The tail is long relative to body size and is green above with a brownish-red underside.

The face has a small patch of bare white skin around the eyes, typical of macaws but smaller in area compared to the large macaw species. The beak is black in juveniles and transitions to a dark upper mandible with a horn-colored (bone/tan) base as the bird matures. Eyes are orange in adults and dark brown in juveniles.

The Hahn's Macaw (*Diopsittaca nobilis nobilis*) is the smaller of the two commonly recognized subspecies of the Red-shouldered Macaw. The other, *Diopsittaca nobilis cumanensis* (often called the Noble Macaw or Long-winged Macaw), is slightly larger with a fully pale upper mandible.

## Temperament & Personality
Hahn's Macaws are lively, playful, and affectionate birds with surprisingly bold personalities for their small size. They are highly social and bond strongly with their owners, often seeking out physical contact and interaction. They are known for being curious, comical, and energetic.

They are among the best talkers of the small parrot species and are considered one of the best-talking macaws relative to their size. Many Hahn's Macaws develop a clear and diverse vocabulary. They can also learn tricks readily and are very responsive to positive reinforcement training.

Noise level is moderate. While they can be vocal and are capable of producing loud calls (especially when excited or seeking attention), their volume is significantly lower than that of large macaws. Their calls are higher-pitched. They can still be noisy by general household standards, particularly in the morning and evening.

They do well in multi-bird households and can be social with other similarly-sized birds when properly introduced. They can be nippy during adolescence but typically outgrow this with consistent, gentle handling and training.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Hahn's Macaws require a cage that accommodates their active nature. A minimum cage size of 61 cm x 61 cm x 91 cm (24 x 24 x 36 inches) is recommended, though larger is always better. Bar spacing should be 1.6–1.9 cm (5/8–3/4 inch) to prevent escape or injury — narrower than what is used for large macaws.

The cage should be equipped with multiple perches of varying sizes and textures, foraging toys, climbing opportunities, and food/water dishes. A play gym or playstand outside the cage is important for out-of-cage time. Hahn's Macaws are active climbers and appreciate cages with horizontal bars that facilitate climbing.

### Diet
A balanced diet should consist of:
- **High-quality pelleted diet**: Approximately 60–70% of the daily intake. Pellet formulations for small to medium parrots or conures are appropriate.
- **Fresh fruits and vegetables**: 20–30% of the diet. Offer a variety of leafy greens, carrots, peas, corn, broccoli, bell peppers, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, grapes, mangoes, and bananas.
- **Seeds and nuts**: Offered in small quantities as treats. Due to their small size, appropriate options include small pieces of walnut, almond, or pine nuts. Sunflower seeds and safflower seeds can be offered sparingly.
- **Sprouted seeds**: A nutritious addition to the diet, offering enhanced vitamins and enzymes compared to dry seeds.
- **Fresh water**: Changed daily.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, fruit pits/seeds, and processed human foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Hahn's Macaws are very energetic and playful. They should have at least 2–3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily. Enrichment should include:
- A variety of toys including shredding toys (paper, palm leaf, balsa wood), foraging toys, and puzzle toys
- Climbing ropes, ladders, and swings
- Interactive play sessions with their owner
- Training sessions — they are eager learners and enjoy trick training
- Foraging opportunities where food is hidden in toys or wrapped in paper
- Bathing opportunities (many enjoy misting or bathing in a shallow dish)
- Social interaction, as they are very people-oriented birds

## Common Health Issues
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Although more commonly associated with large macaws, Hahn's Macaws can also be affected by this viral condition (avian bornavirus) causing gastrointestinal and neurological signs.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*, presenting with respiratory signs, lethargy, and fluffed feathers.
- **Conure Bleeding Syndrome**: Some small macaws and conures may be prone to unexplained bleeding episodes, potentially related to vitamin K or calcium deficiencies. Ensuring adequate dietary nutrition is important for prevention.
- **Aspergillosis**: Fungal respiratory infection, particularly in stressed or immunocompromised birds.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: Circoviral disease that can affect feather and beak quality and compromise the immune system.
- **Feather Destructive Behavior**: Can occur due to boredom, stress, hormonal issues, or lack of social interaction. Hahn's Macaws are social birds that can develop behavioral issues if left alone for extended periods.
- **Vitamin A Deficiency**: Common in birds fed predominantly seed diets without adequate fresh vegetables.
- **Obesity**: Can occur if the diet is too high in seeds and nuts and the bird does not receive adequate exercise.
- **Respiratory Infections**: Bacterial or viral upper respiratory infections, sometimes triggered by environmental factors (drafts, poor air quality, smoke).

## Breeding Information
Hahn's Macaws reach sexual maturity at approximately 2–3 years of age, earlier than most larger macaw species. In the wild, they nest in tree cavities, often in palm trees or termite mounds. In captivity, they require a nesting box approximately 30 cm x 30 cm x 46 cm (12 x 12 x 18 inches) with an entrance hole of about 7.5 cm (3 inches) in diameter, lined with wood shavings.

The typical clutch size is 3–5 eggs (larger than most macaw species relative to body size). Incubation is performed primarily by the female and lasts approximately 24–26 days. Chicks fledge at around 54–70 days of age. Hahn's Macaws can be prolific breeders in captivity, and pairs may produce multiple clutches per year if conditions are favorable. However, allowing continuous breeding is not recommended as it can deplete the hen's calcium reserves and affect her health.
