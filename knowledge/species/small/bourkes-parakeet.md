# Bourke's Parakeet (*Neopsephotus bourkii*)

## Overview
Bourke's parakeet (also spelled Bourke's parrot or Bourke parakeet) is a small, gentle grass parakeet native to the arid interior of Australia. Named after Sir Richard Bourke, Governor of New South Wales in the 1830s, this species is admired for its soft pastel plumage, quiet disposition, and calm temperament. Bourke's parakeets are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during dawn and dusk, which is unusual among commonly kept parrot species. They are an excellent choice for bird owners seeking a quiet, low-maintenance companion with a sweet nature.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (sometimes classified under Psittaculidae; Tribe: Neophemini -- Australian grass parakeets)
- **Origin**: Arid and semi-arid interior of Australia, particularly central and western regions of New South Wales, South Australia, Queensland, and Western Australia
- **Size**: 18-23 cm (7-9 inches)
- **Weight**: 40-50 g (approximately 1.4-1.8 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-25 years in captivity, with some individuals reaching up to 25 years or more with proper care; average is approximately 15 years

## Appearance
The wild-type Bourke's parakeet has a distinctive soft, pastel color palette unlike the vivid greens of many other parrot species. The upper body is brownish-grey with each feather edged in lighter brown, giving a scalloped appearance. The breast and abdomen are soft pink, the wings show a blend of blue, brown, and grey, and a patch of blue appears on the rump and above the cere. The tail is blue-brown with white outer tail feathers. The eyes are dark brown, and the beak is a yellowish-brown horn color. Males and females are similar but can be distinguished: males have a more prominent blue band above the cere (frontal band) and generally more vivid pink coloring on the breast. Females tend to be slightly duller.

Color mutations include:
- **Rosa (Opaline)**: The most popular mutation. Enhanced pink coloring across the breast, face, and abdomen with reduced brown tones. The overall effect is a strikingly pink bird. Sometimes called "Rosy Bourke's."
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with pink wash and red eyes.
- **Yellow (Fallow)**: Pale yellow body with subtle pink and red eyes.
- **Cream**: Very pale, washed-out coloring.
- **Rubino**: A combination of rosa and lutino, producing an intensely pink bird with red eyes.
- **Pale fallow and Cinnamon**: Lighter or warmer-toned variations.

## Temperament & Personality
Bourke's parakeets are among the most gentle and calm parrot species available as pets:

- **Noise level**: Very low. They are one of the quietest parrot species, producing soft, melodic chirps and warbling, particularly during dawn and dusk. They are ideal for apartments and noise-sensitive living situations.
- **Talking ability**: Very limited. Bourke's parakeets are not known for talking ability. Some individuals may learn to whistle simple tunes, but speech mimicry is rare.
- **Temperament**: Gentle, placid, and non-aggressive. They are not typically nippy and rarely bite, even when startled. They tolerate handling well but are not as actively cuddly or attention-seeking as some other species. They tend to be observational and enjoy being near their owners without demanding constant interaction.
- **Activity pattern**: Crepuscular -- most active during early morning and late evening/dusk. They tend to be quieter and more sedentary during the middle of the day. This can make them a good match for owners who work during the day.
- **Social behavior**: Generally peaceful with other birds, including other Bourke's and small grass parakeets (such as budgerigars or scarlet-chested parakeets). They are less aggressive than lovebirds or parrotlets.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird, though larger is strongly recommended. A flight cage of at least 90 cm (36") wide is ideal, as Bourke's parakeets enjoy flying more than climbing.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2")
- **Setup**: Multiple perches of varying diameters, food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and toys. Bourke's parakeets are not as destructive as many other parrot species, so toys can include swings, bells, and small wooden toys. They appreciate gentle, natural perching materials.
- **Lighting**: Because they are crepuscular, Bourke's parakeets may become active during twilight hours. A gradual dimming light cycle (rather than abrupt darkness) can help accommodate their natural rhythms and reduce stress.
- **Flight space**: They are strong, swift flyers and benefit greatly from flight cages or aviaries where they can fly freely. In-home flight in a bird-safe room is also beneficial.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 50-60%). Small-sized formulated pellets are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A quality grass seed and small seed mix can supplement the diet (approximately 25-30%). Bourke's parakeets naturally forage on grass seeds and enjoy millet, canary seed, and small amounts of niger and oat groats.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens, carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, peas, corn, and sweet potato.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of apple, berries, melon, and grapes as treats.
- **Grasses and greens**: Bourke's parakeets enjoy fresh grasses, seeding grasses, and edible herbs (such as basil, parsley, and dill), which mimic their natural foraging behavior.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.
- **Grit**: Some aviculturists offer a small amount of mineralized grit, though this is debated. Cuttlebone and mineral blocks are universally recommended.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Bourke's parakeets benefit from flight-based exercise. Provide the largest enclosure possible or regular flight time in a bird-safe room.
- They are less interactive with toys compared to lovebirds or parrotlets but appreciate swings, natural branches, and gentle foraging opportunities.
- Bathing through gentle misting or a shallow dish is enjoyed, though they may be less enthusiastic bathers than some other species.
- Social time with their owner or a companion bird is beneficial, though they are more independent than many other small parrots.
- Outdoor aviary time (in appropriate climates and with predator protection) is excellent for Bourke's parakeets.

## Common Health Issues
Bourke's parakeets are generally hardy birds, but can be susceptible to:

- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial and fungal infections, including aspergillosis.
- **Intestinal parasites**: Including roundworms and coccidia, especially in aviary-housed birds with access to soil or natural substrates.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A and calcium deficiency from seed-only diets. Vitamin D3 deficiency if kept indoors without full-spectrum lighting.
- **Obesity and fatty liver disease**: From high-fat seed diets and insufficient flight exercise.
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus infection causing feather abnormalities and immune suppression.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Can affect single females, leading to calcium depletion and potential egg binding.
- **Eye problems**: Some mutations (particularly lutino and fallow) may be more prone to eye sensitivity.
- **Bumblefoot (pododermatitis)**: Infection of the feet, often caused by inappropriate perch surfaces or poor hygiene.
- **Night frights**: Like cockatiels, Bourke's parakeets can experience night frights, particularly since they are active during dim light conditions. A nightlight can help.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 8-12 months, though breeding should ideally be delayed until approximately 1 year.
- **Clutch size**: 3-6 eggs, typically 4-5.
- **Incubation period**: 18-19 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 4 weeks (28-30 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 6-8 weeks after hatching.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 20 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm (8" x 8" x 12") with a 5-6 cm (2") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings.
- Bourke's parakeets are generally easy to breed in captivity and make attentive parents.
- They are best bred in single pairs rather than colony settings to prevent aggression during nesting.
- Breeding season in the wild coincides with the Australian spring (August-December), though captive birds may breed at different times depending on photoperiod and temperature.
