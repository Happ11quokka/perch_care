# Lineolated Parakeet (*Bolborhynchus lineola*)

## Overview
The lineolated parakeet (commonly called the "linnie") is a small, calm, and charming parrot species native to the highland forests of Central and South America. Named for the fine dark barring or "lineolations" on their green plumage, these parakeets have gained a dedicated following among aviculturists for their gentle temperament, relatively quiet nature, and unusual posture -- they often perch and walk in a nearly horizontal position rather than the upright stance typical of most parrots. Linnies are excellent companion birds for those seeking a quiet, sweet-natured small parrot.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Subfamily: Psittacinae)
- **Origin**: Highland forests of southern Mexico, Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama), and western South America (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia), typically found at elevations of 1,500-3,000 meters (5,000-10,000 feet)
- **Size**: 16-17 cm (6-6.5 inches)
- **Weight**: 42-55 g (approximately 1.5-2.0 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 10-15 years in captivity; some individuals may live up to 20 years with excellent care

## Appearance
The wild-type lineolated parakeet is predominantly green with subtle dark green to black barring (lineolations) across the back, wings, and flanks. The barring is more prominent on the upper body and less visible on the underparts. They have a short tail, a stocky build, and small dark eyes. Their overall body shape is compact and somewhat plump. Males and females are visually similar (monomorphic), though males may show slightly broader or darker barring. DNA sexing is the most reliable method for sex determination.

Color mutations bred in captivity include:
- **Lutino**: Bright yellow body with no barring and red eyes.
- **Cremino**: Pale cream/yellow body, lighter than lutino.
- **Cobalt (Dark green)**: Darker green than normal with more prominent barring.
- **Turquoise**: Blue-green body coloration.
- **Blue (Mauve)**: Blue-grey body replacing the green.
- **Cinnamon**: Warm brownish barring on a lighter green body.
- **Violet**: Deep violet-blue body.
- **Dark factor**: Intensified versions of each base color.

## Temperament & Personality
Lineolated parakeets are known for their calm, gentle, and easy-going personalities:

- **Noise level**: Low. Linnies are among the quietest parrot species, producing soft chattering, murmuring, and gentle vocalizations. They are well-suited for apartment living and noise-sensitive environments.
- **Talking ability**: Moderate. Linnies can learn a small vocabulary of words and phrases, though their voice is soft and somewhat mumbled. They are better at mimicking sounds and tunes than speaking clearly.
- **Temperament**: Extremely gentle and rarely nippy. They are social, enjoy being held, and often like to nestle in pockets, hoods, or sleeves. They tend to be less excitable than many other small parrots.
- **Unique behaviors**: Linnies have a distinctive horizontal posture when perching and walking. They are also known for walking along flat surfaces rather than climbing as much as other parrots. They enjoy hanging upside down and playing on flat surfaces.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm (24" x 18" x 18") for a single bird; a wider cage is preferred as linnies tend to walk and hop more than fly.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2")
- **Setup**: Multiple perches of varying diameters, food and water dishes, and toys. Linnies enjoy flat platforms and shallow dishes for bathing. Include ladders, swings, and foraging toys. They appreciate having cozy spots to retreat into.
- **Substrate**: Linnies tend to spend time on the cage floor more than many other parrot species, so clean paper or appropriate cage liner should be maintained.
- **Temperature**: Being highland birds, linnies are somewhat more tolerant of cooler temperatures than tropical parrot species, but they should still be kept in comfortable indoor temperatures (18-27 degrees C / 65-80 degrees F) and away from drafts.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 50-60%). Small-sized formulated pellets are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A quality small-seed mix can supplement the diet (approximately 20-30%). Linnies enjoy millet, canary seed, and small amounts of oat groats.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens (kale, romaine, dandelion greens), carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, peas, corn, and zucchini.
- **Fresh fruits**: Berries, apple, grapes, banana, and kiwi in small amounts as treats.
- **Sprouted seeds**: Excellent nutritional supplement that linnies particularly enjoy.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times. Linnies enjoy bathing in their water dishes, so dishes may need frequent changing.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Daily out-of-cage time is recommended, though linnies are less demanding of exercise than some other species.
- They enjoy walking on flat surfaces, exploring tabletops, and snuggling with their owners.
- Provide foraging opportunities and destructible toys (paper, soft wood, woven grass).
- Bathing is a particular favorite -- offer a shallow dish of water, as many linnies will wade in and splash enthusiastically.
- Social interaction is important; they are flock-oriented and enjoy companionship.

## Common Health Issues
Lineolated parakeets are generally robust but can be affected by:

- **Obesity**: Can occur with high-fat seed diets and sedentary habits, as linnies are not as naturally active as some other small parrots.
- **Fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Often associated with seed-heavy diets and obesity.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory and systemic illness. Zoonotic.
- **Respiratory infections**: Including aspergillosis, particularly in damp environments. Being from humid highland forests, linnies need adequate ventilation but not excessively dry conditions.
- **Polyomavirus**: Primarily affects young birds, causing acute illness.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Single females may lay excessively, leading to calcium depletion and potential egg binding.
- **Gastrointestinal infections**: Bacterial or yeast (candidiasis) infections of the crop or intestines.
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, or underlying medical conditions, though this is less common in linnies than in some other species.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: From ingestion of zinc or lead in cage hardware or household items.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A and calcium deficiency in birds on poor diets.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 1 year of age.
- **Clutch size**: 4-6 eggs.
- **Incubation period**: 18-22 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 5-6 weeks.
- **Weaning**: Complete weaning by approximately 7-8 weeks.
- **Nest box**: A small wooden nest box approximately 15 cm x 15 cm x 25 cm (6" x 6" x 10") with a 5 cm (2") entrance hole. Line the bottom with untreated wood shavings or shredded paper.
- Linnies are generally good parents and are cooperative breeders in captivity.
- Breeding pairs should be in good health, at least 1 year old, and on a nutritionally complete diet before pairing.
