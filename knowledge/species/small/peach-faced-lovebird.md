# Peach-faced Lovebird (*Agapornis roseicollis*)

## Overview
The peach-faced lovebird (also known as the rosy-faced lovebird) is the most commonly kept lovebird species in aviculture and is native to the arid regions of southwestern Africa. They are small, stocky parrots known for their vibrant plumage, strong pair bonding behavior, and spirited personality. Their name derives from the strong monogamous bonds they form with their mates. Peach-faced lovebirds are active, entertaining, and can be affectionate when properly socialized, though they are also known for being feisty and territorial.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Tribe: Agapornithini)
- **Origin**: Southwestern Africa (Namibia, southwestern Angola, and northwestern South Africa)
- **Size**: 15-18 cm (6-7 inches)
- **Weight**: 46-63 g (approximately 1.6-2.2 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-25 years in captivity with proper care; average is around 15-20 years

## Appearance
The wild-type peach-faced lovebird is predominantly green with a bright peach-pink face and throat that fades to a salmon color on the upper breast. The forehead is red, the rump is blue, and the tail feathers have blue, green, and black coloring. The beak is horn-colored, and the feet are grey. There is no reliable visual difference between males and females (monomorphic), though DNA or surgical sexing can determine gender.

Extensive captive breeding has produced many color mutations, including:
- **Dutch Blue (Blue mutation)**: Blue body with a white or pale face replacing the green and peach.
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with a bright red/orange face and red eyes.
- **Cremino**: Pale yellow/cream body with a light orange face.
- **Pied**: Patches of yellow or lighter coloring on the normal green body.
- **Cinnamon**: Warm brownish-green replacing normal green.
- **Violet**: Deep violet-blue coloration on the rump and body.
- **Opaline (also called "orange-face")**: Extended peach/orange coloring across more of the head and body.
- **Whitefaced blue, Fallow, Pallid**: Additional established mutations and their combinations.

## Temperament & Personality
Peach-faced lovebirds are bold, energetic, and highly social birds with strong personalities:

- **Noise level**: Moderate to high. They produce sharp, high-pitched calls and chattering that can be piercing, especially when excited or seeking attention. They are louder than budgies but quieter than larger parrots.
- **Talking ability**: Very limited. While some individuals may learn a few words, lovebirds are not known for their talking ability. They are more likely to mimic sounds or whistles.
- **Temperament**: Lovebirds are curious, playful, and can be quite nippy, especially during hormonal periods. A single, hand-raised lovebird can bond strongly with its owner, but may become territorial or aggressive toward other household members. They are known for their fearless attitude despite their small size.
- **Pair bonding**: True to their name, peach-faced lovebirds form intense bonds with partners (avian or human). Contrary to popular myth, they do not need to be kept in pairs, but a single bird requires substantial human interaction.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird or pair; larger is recommended as lovebirds are very active.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2"). Lovebirds are small but strong chewers.
- **Setup**: Provide multiple perches of varying diameters, food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and abundant toys. Lovebirds are avid chewers and need a steady supply of chewable and shreddable toys (palm leaves, paper, softwood). Include swings and foraging toys.
- **Placement**: Well-lit area away from drafts and kitchen fumes. Lovebirds enjoy being near family activity.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should comprise approximately 60-70% of the diet. High-quality formulated pellets provide balanced nutrition.
- **Seeds**: A small seed mix can supplement the diet but should not exceed 20-30%. Lovebirds prefer small seeds such as millet, canary seed, and safflower.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, dandelion greens), carrots, bell peppers, broccoli, corn, peas, and green beans.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small portions of berries, apple, grapes, banana, mango, and papaya as treats.
- **Sprouted seeds**: Excellent nutritional supplement; lovebirds particularly enjoy sprouted mung beans and lentils.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water daily.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Lovebirds are extremely active and need ample exercise. Daily out-of-cage time is important (at least 2-3 hours supervised).
- Provide abundant chewing and shredding materials -- lovebirds have a natural instinct to tuck nesting material into their rump feathers.
- Foraging toys and puzzles help engage their intelligence.
- Bathing is a favorite activity; provide a shallow dish or gentle misting.
- Social interaction is essential, whether with another lovebird or with their human companion.

## Common Health Issues
Peach-faced lovebirds are susceptible to several health conditions:

- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: A viral disease caused by circovirus that leads to progressive feather loss, beak deformities, and immunosuppression. There is no cure, and it is often fatal.
- **Polyomavirus**: Affects young birds, causing lethargy, crop stasis, and sudden death.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory signs, lethargy, and green droppings. Zoonotic.
- **Chronic egg laying and egg binding**: Common in single females. Egg binding is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate veterinary care. Ensure adequate calcium and avoid hormonal triggers.
- **Self-mutilation and feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, hormonal changes, or medical conditions.
- **Respiratory infections**: Including aspergillosis (a fungal infection), particularly in damp or poorly ventilated environments.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Caused by avian bornavirus, affecting the nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, leading to weight loss and undigested food in droppings.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A deficiency and calcium deficiency are common in birds on seed-only diets.
- **Liver disease**: Often associated with high-fat diets.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 10-12 months, though breeding is best delayed until the bird is at least 1 year old.
- **Clutch size**: 4-6 eggs.
- **Incubation period**: 23 days on average.
- **Fledging**: Chicks fledge at approximately 5-6 weeks.
- **Weaning**: Complete weaning occurs around 8 weeks of age.
- **Nest box**: Approximately 20 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm (8" x 8" x 12") with a 5-6 cm (2") entrance hole. Peach-faced lovebirds are unique among lovebird species in that the female tucks nesting material (strips of bark, paper, or palm leaves) into her rump feathers to carry it to the nest.
- Females can lay eggs without a male present. Chronic egg laying should be discouraged through environmental management.
