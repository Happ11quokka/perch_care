# Fischer's Lovebird (*Agapornis fischeri*)

## Overview
Fischer's lovebird is a small, colorful parrot native to a limited range in east-central Africa. Named after German explorer Gustav Fischer, this species is one of the most popular lovebird species in aviculture alongside the peach-faced lovebird. Fischer's lovebirds are known for their striking multicolored plumage, social nature, and energetic personality. They are classified as Near Threatened in the wild due to habitat loss and trapping for the pet trade, though they breed readily in captivity.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Tribe: Agapornithini)
- **Origin**: East-central Africa; specifically a small region south and southeast of Lake Victoria in north-central Tanzania
- **Size**: 14-15 cm (5.5-6 inches)
- **Weight**: 42-58 g (approximately 1.5-2.0 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
Fischer's lovebirds are among the most colorful of the lovebird species. The wild-type bird has a predominantly green body, a bright orange face and forehead that blends into olive-yellow on the crown and back of the head, a red-orange beak, and a prominent white eye ring (a distinguishing feature among "eye-ring" lovebird species). The breast is yellow-green transitioning to green on the wings, and the rump is blue-violet. The tail is green with blue and black markings. Like other lovebirds, Fischer's are sexually monomorphic (males and females look identical), requiring DNA or surgical sexing.

Available color mutations include:
- **Blue**: Blue body with a white or pale grey head replacing the orange/green. The beak is pale pink.
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with a red/orange face and red eyes.
- **Yellow**: Diluted green resulting in an overall yellow-green appearance.
- **Dilute (Pastel)**: Softened version of the normal coloring.
- **Pied**: Irregular patches of yellow on the green body.
- **Albino**: All-white with red eyes (combination of blue and lutino).
- **Cinnamon and Violet**: Less common mutations.

Note: Fischer's lovebirds can hybridize with other eye-ring species (masked, black-cheeked, and Nyasa lovebirds) in captivity. Hybridization is strongly discouraged by aviculturists to preserve the genetic integrity of each species.

## Temperament & Personality
Fischer's lovebirds share many behavioral traits with other lovebird species but have some distinctive characteristics:

- **Noise level**: Moderate to high. They have a high-pitched, shrill call that they use frequently, especially in the morning and evening. They can be noisy birds for their size.
- **Talking ability**: Very limited. Fischer's lovebirds are not talkers but may mimic some sounds or whistles with training.
- **Temperament**: Playful, active, and curious. Fischer's lovebirds can be slightly less aggressive than peach-faced lovebirds when well-socialized. They are social birds that thrive on companionship, whether from another lovebird or their human caretaker.
- **Pair bonding**: Like all lovebirds, Fischer's form strong pair bonds. They can be kept singly if given ample human attention, but many owners keep them in pairs for companionship. A bonded pair will preen each other, sit closely together, and feed each other.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird or pair. A flight cage of 90 cm (36") or longer is ideal.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2")
- **Setup**: Provide multiple perches of varying diameters and textures, food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and plenty of toys. Fischer's lovebirds are enthusiastic chewers and need destructible toys (wood blocks, woven palm leaves, paper). Include swings and climbing structures.
- **Placement**: In a well-lit, draft-free area at a comfortable height. Avoid proximity to the kitchen due to fume hazards.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should constitute 60-70% of the diet. Small-size formulated pellets are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A limited seed mix (20-30%) including millet, canary seed, and small amounts of safflower and oats.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Daily offerings of dark leafy greens, carrots, bell peppers, squash, corn, peas, and broccoli.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of berries, apple, banana, papaya, and mango as treats.
- **Sprouted seeds and legumes**: An excellent nutritional supplement.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Clean, fresh water must be available at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Fischer's lovebirds are highly active and need daily out-of-cage exercise in a bird-safe space (minimum 2 hours).
- Provide a constant supply of chewing and shredding materials.
- Foraging toys and puzzle feeders help stimulate their active minds.
- Bathing is greatly enjoyed -- offer a shallow dish of water or a gentle spray.
- Social interaction (with another bird or human) is critical for emotional well-being.

## Common Health Issues
Fischer's lovebirds are generally hardy but susceptible to several conditions:

- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus infection causing feather loss, beak abnormalities, and immune suppression. No cure exists.
- **Polyomavirus**: Primarily affects nestlings and juvenile birds, causing acute illness and sudden death.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection with respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Avian bornavirus / Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Neurological and gastrointestinal disease causing wasting and undigested food in droppings.
- **Chronic egg laying and egg binding**: Common in single females. Egg binding requires emergency veterinary intervention.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial and fungal (aspergillosis), especially in poorly ventilated environments.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A and calcium deficiencies from seed-only diets.
- **Knemidokoptes mites (scaly face/leg)**: Causes crusty lesions on the beak, cere, and legs.
- **Eye infections**: Fischer's lovebirds' prominent eye rings can sometimes be prone to irritation and infection.
- **Liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Associated with high-fat, seed-based diets.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 10-12 months, though breeding is best delayed until approximately 1 year of age.
- **Clutch size**: 3-8 eggs, typically 4-5.
- **Incubation period**: 23 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 38-42 days.
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 6-8 weeks after fledging.
- **Nest box**: Approximately 20 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm (8" x 8" x 12") with appropriate nesting material (shredded paper, bark strips, palm fronds). Unlike peach-faced lovebirds, Fischer's lovebirds carry nesting material in their beaks rather than tucking it into their rump feathers.
- Fischer's lovebirds hybridize readily with other eye-ring species, which should be prevented to maintain pure species genetics.
