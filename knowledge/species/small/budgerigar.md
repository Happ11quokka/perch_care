# Budgerigar (*Melopsittacus undulatus*)

## Overview
The budgerigar, commonly known as the budgie or parakeet, is the most popular pet bird species in the world. Native to Australia, these small, social parrots are prized for their cheerful disposition, ability to mimic speech, and relatively easy care requirements. They are the only species in the genus *Melopsittacus* and have been bred in captivity since the 1850s, resulting in a wide array of color mutations.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Tribe: Melopsittacini)
- **Origin**: Inland Australia (arid and semi-arid regions across much of the continent)
- **Size**: 18-20 cm (7-8 inches) from head to tail tip
- **Weight**: 30-40 g (approximately 1-1.4 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 5-8 years on average in captivity; well-cared-for individuals can live 10-15 years or occasionally longer

## Appearance
Wild-type budgerigars are predominantly green with a yellow face and head, with black barring and scalloping on the wings, back, and head. They have a small, curved beak, blue cere (the fleshy area above the beak), and long tail feathers. The cere color helps determine sex in adults: blue in males, brown or tan in females (though this can vary in certain color mutations).

Through selective captive breeding, over 30 color mutations exist, including:
- **Blue series**: Sky blue, cobalt, mauve, violet
- **White series**: Albino (all white with red eyes)
- **Yellow series**: Lutino (all yellow with red eyes)
- **Grey and grey-green**
- **Pied varieties**: Dominant pied, recessive pied, clearflight
- **Spangle, opaline, cinnamon, and lacewing**

English or "show" budgies are larger (22-24 cm) with more prominent head feathering compared to the standard American or Australian-type budgie.

## Temperament & Personality
Budgerigars are highly social, playful, and curious birds. They form strong bonds with their owners and can be quite affectionate when hand-tamed. They thrive on interaction and should not be left in isolation for extended periods.

- **Noise level**: Moderate. They vocalize with pleasant chattering and singing throughout the day but are not excessively loud.
- **Talking ability**: Excellent for their size. Male budgies in particular are capable of learning extensive vocabularies, sometimes over 100 words. They were once recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest vocabulary of any bird (over 1,700 words).
- **Trainability**: Highly trainable. They can learn tricks, step up, and respond to cues with consistent positive reinforcement.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 45 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (18" x 18" x 24") for a single bird; larger is always better
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2")
- **Setup**: Provide multiple perches of varying diameters and materials (natural wood branches preferred), food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and several toys. Budgies are horizontal flyers, so a wider cage is preferable to a tall, narrow one.
- **Placement**: Keep the cage in a well-lit area away from drafts, direct sunlight, and kitchen fumes (PTFE/Teflon fumes are lethal to birds). A quiet corner at chest height provides a sense of security.

### Diet
A balanced diet is essential for budgerigar health:
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 60-70%). Formulated pellets provide balanced nutrition.
- **Seeds**: Can be offered in limited quantities as a supplement but should not constitute the entire diet, as an all-seed diet leads to nutritional deficiencies (particularly vitamin A and calcium).
- **Fresh vegetables**: Dark leafy greens (kale, spinach, romaine lettuce), carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, and squash should be offered daily.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small portions of apple, berries, melon, and grapes (seedless) can be offered as treats.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits are toxic.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water must be available at all times.
- **Supplements**: A cuttlebone or mineral block should always be available for calcium and beak conditioning.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Budgies are active birds that require daily exercise:
- Supervised out-of-cage time in a bird-safe room is strongly recommended (at least 1-2 hours daily).
- Provide a variety of toys including bells, mirrors, swings, ladders, and foraging toys. Rotate toys regularly to prevent boredom.
- Social interaction is critical; budgies housed alone require more human interaction. Keeping two or more budgies together can help meet their social needs.
- Bathing opportunities (a shallow dish of water or light misting) should be offered regularly.

## Common Health Issues
Budgerigars are susceptible to several health conditions:

- **Budgerigar fledgling disease (Polyomavirus)**: A viral disease primarily affecting young birds, causing feather abnormalities, abdominal distension, and often sudden death. Vaccination is available.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*, presenting with respiratory signs, lethargy, and green/yellow droppings. Zoonotic (transmissible to humans).
- **Megabacteriosis (Avian Gastric Yeast / *Macrorhabdus ornithogaster*)**: A fungal infection of the proventriculus causing chronic wasting, regurgitation, and passage of undigested food. Common in budgerigars.
- **Scaly face and leg mites (*Knemidokoptes* spp.)**: Causes crusty, honeycomb-like lesions on the cere, beak, and legs. Treated with ivermectin.
- **Tumors and cancers**: Budgerigars are particularly prone to tumors, including lipomas (fatty tumors), renal tumors, gonadal tumors, and xanthomas. This is often linked to all-seed diets and obesity.
- **Goiter (thyroid hyperplasia)**: Caused by iodine deficiency, particularly in seed-only diets. Leads to difficulty breathing and regurgitation.
- **Obesity and hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease)**: Common in birds fed high-fat, seed-based diets with insufficient exercise.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal respiratory infections presenting with tail bobbing, open-mouth breathing, and nasal discharge.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 6-8 months, though breeding is best postponed until 1 year of age.
- **Clutch size**: 4-8 eggs.
- **Incubation period**: 18-21 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 4-5 weeks of age.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 23 cm x 15 cm x 15 cm (9" x 6" x 6") with a concave bottom to prevent splayed legs in chicks.
- Hens can become egg-bound, especially young or calcium-deficient birds, which is a medical emergency.
- Chronic egg laying in single females can be addressed by reducing daylight hours, removing perceived nesting sites, and dietary management.
