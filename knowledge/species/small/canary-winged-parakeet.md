# Canary-winged Parakeet (*Brotogeris versicolurus*)

## Overview
The Canary-winged Parakeet is a small, energetic parrot native to the Amazon basin of South America. Named for the bright yellow patch on its wing coverts, this species became widely popular as a pet bird in the 1970s and 1980s due to its affectionate personality and ability to bond closely with owners. Though importation has since been restricted, captive-bred Canary-winged Parakeets remain valued companions known for their playful nature and surprising cuddliness for their size.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Tribe: Arini -- Neotropical parrots)
- **Origin**: Amazon River basin, including parts of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; feral populations established in parts of Florida and California
- **Size**: 22-25 cm (8.5-10 inches)
- **Weight**: 60-80 g (approximately 2.1-2.8 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years in captivity, with some individuals reported to live up to 25 years with excellent care

## Appearance
The Canary-winged Parakeet is predominantly bright green, slightly paler on the underparts. The most distinctive feature is the bright canary-yellow patch on the outer wing coverts (secondary coverts), which is visible both in flight and at rest. The primary flight feathers are dark blue-green to blackish, and the outer primary coverts show white to pale yellow coloring. The tail is green with yellowish-green tips. The beak is horn-colored to pinkish-brown, and the eyes are dark brown with a pale grey periorbital ring. The legs are pinkish-grey.

Sexual dimorphism is minimal -- males and females are visually identical, and surgical sexing or DNA testing is required for accurate sex determination.

Color mutations are extremely rare in captivity. Occasional lutino or dilute individuals have been reported but are not established as reliably bred mutations.

## Temperament & Personality
- **Noise level**: Moderate. They can produce shrill, high-pitched calls, especially during morning and evening. However, they are generally quieter than conures or lories of similar size. Their contact calls can be loud but are typically brief.
- **Talking ability**: Limited but possible. Some individuals learn a few words or short phrases, though they are not considered strong talkers. They are more likely to learn whistles and sound mimicry.
- **Temperament**: Extremely affectionate and cuddly when hand-raised. They are known for burrowing into clothing, hiding in pockets, and seeking physical contact with their owners. They can be feisty and confident despite their small size, and may become territorial around their cage.
- **Activity pattern**: Diurnal and highly active. They are energetic birds that enjoy climbing, swinging, and exploring. They tend to be most active in the morning and late afternoon.
- **Social behavior**: Highly social and flock-oriented. In the wild, they congregate in large flocks. In captivity, they bond strongly to their owner and may become jealous or nippy with others. They can coexist with other Brotogeris species but may be aggressive toward other small birds.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird, though a flight cage of at least 75 cm (30") wide is recommended given their active nature.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.5 cm (3/8" to 5/8")
- **Setup**: Multiple perches of varying diameters and materials, food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and a variety of toys. They enjoy swings, ladders, and small foraging toys. Provide a sleeping hut or tent, as they love to burrow and sleep in enclosed spaces.
- **Flight space**: They are agile and fast flyers. Regular out-of-cage flight time in a bird-safe room is highly beneficial for their physical and mental health.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form approximately 50-60% of the diet. Small-sized formulated pellets are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A small amount of quality small seed mix (approximately 10-15%) can supplement the diet. They enjoy spray millet, canary seed, and small amounts of sunflower.
- **Fresh fruits**: A significant part of the diet -- they are naturally frugivorous. Offer apple, banana, berries, grapes, mango, papaya, melon, and kiwi daily.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Dark leafy greens, carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, corn, peas, and green beans.
- **Flowers and blossoms**: In the wild, they feed on nectar and blossoms. Safe edible flowers (such as hibiscus, nasturtium, and dandelion) can be offered as enrichment.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Canary-winged Parakeets are highly active and need daily out-of-cage time for flying and exploration. A minimum of 2-3 hours of supervised free-flight time is recommended.
- They enjoy a wide variety of toys, especially swings, leather strips, small wooden blocks, and foraging toys that require manipulation to access treats.
- Bathing is greatly enjoyed -- offer a shallow dish of water or gentle misting several times per week. Many individuals will eagerly bathe in a dish of wet lettuce leaves.
- Social interaction with their owner is essential. They thrive on physical contact and can become depressed or develop behavioral issues if left alone for extended periods.

## Common Health Issues
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic risk.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial and fungal infections, including aspergillosis, particularly in poorly ventilated environments.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A and calcium deficiency from seed-only diets. Their frugivorous tendencies mean they need careful dietary balance.
- **Obesity and fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: From high-fat seed diets and insufficient exercise.
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, or hormonal imbalances, particularly in birds that lack sufficient social interaction.
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus infection affecting feathers and immune system.
- **Gastrointestinal parasites**: Including roundworms and Giardia, especially in imported or aviary-housed birds.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Can affect single females, leading to calcium depletion and egg binding.
- **Bumblefoot (pododermatitis)**: Foot infections from improper perching surfaces.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Approximately 1-2 years of age.
- **Clutch size**: 4-5 eggs, occasionally up to 6.
- **Incubation period**: 25-26 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 7-8 weeks (49-56 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 10-12 weeks after hatching.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 20 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm (8" x 8" x 12") with a 5 cm (2") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings.
- Canary-winged Parakeets can be moderately difficult to breed in captivity. They require a strong pair bond and a quiet, undisturbed nesting environment.
- Both parents share incubation duties and chick feeding. They are generally attentive parents.
- Breeding success is improved with a diet enriched in calcium, protein, and fresh fruits during the breeding season.
