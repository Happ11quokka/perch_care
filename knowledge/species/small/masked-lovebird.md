# Masked Lovebird (*Agapornis personatus*)

## Overview
The Masked Lovebird (also known as the Yellow-collared Lovebird) is a small, vibrant parrot native to northeastern Tanzania. Named for the distinctive black "mask" covering its face, this species is one of the most popular lovebird species kept as pets worldwide. Masked Lovebirds are known for their bold personality, striking coloration, and strong pair-bonding behavior. They are an excellent choice for bird enthusiasts who enjoy active, entertaining companions.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Subfamily: Agapornithinae)
- **Origin**: Northeastern Tanzania, primarily the inland plateaus south and east of Lake Victoria; feral populations established in Burundi and Kenya
- **Size**: 14-15 cm (5.5-6 inches)
- **Weight**: 43-55 g (approximately 1.5-1.9 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years in captivity with proper care; average is approximately 10-15 years

## Appearance
The wild-type Masked Lovebird has a striking and easily recognizable appearance. The head is covered by a blackish-brown to jet-black "mask" extending from the forehead across the face and throat. The eyes are surrounded by a prominent bare white eye-ring (periorbital ring), a characteristic shared with other "eye-ring" lovebird species. A bright yellow collar encircles the neck and upper breast, transitioning to green on the lower breast, abdomen, wings, and back. The rump is blue-violet, and the tail is green with blue and black markings. The beak is bright red, the eyes are dark brown, and the legs are grey.

Sexual dimorphism is minimal. Females may have a slightly broader head and wider pelvic bones, but visual sexing is unreliable. DNA or surgical sexing is recommended.

Color mutations include:
- **Blue**: The most common mutation. Yellow pigment is absent, producing a white collar, blue body, and black mask. The beak is pale horn-colored.
- **Dilute (Yellow)**: Reduced melanin produces softer, lighter coloring with a pale green body and lighter mask.
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with red eyes and a pale beak. The mask is greatly reduced or absent.
- **Albino**: White body, red eyes, no mask. Produced by combining blue and lutino mutations.
- **Violet**: Enhanced blue mutation with a deeper violet body color.
- **Dark factor (Single and Double)**: Produces darker green (single dark = dark green, double dark = olive) or darker blue (single dark = cobalt, double dark = mauve) variations.
- **Slate**: A grey-blue body with a dark mask.
- **Dilute Blue (Silver)**: Pale blue-grey body with white collar and softened mask.
- **Pied**: Irregular patches of yellow/white mixed with normal coloring.

## Temperament & Personality
- **Noise level**: Moderate. They produce frequent high-pitched chirps and chattering, particularly during morning and evening. They are louder than budgerigars but generally quieter than conures. Their calls can be shrill and persistent.
- **Talking ability**: Very limited. Masked Lovebirds rarely learn to mimic human speech. Some individuals may learn a word or two, but this is uncommon. They are more likely to mimic household sounds or whistles.
- **Temperament**: Bold, energetic, curious, and sometimes feisty. They can be nippy, especially if not well-socialized. Hand-raised birds can be affectionate and enjoy interacting with their owners, though they are generally less cuddly than cockatoos or some other small parrots. They have strong personalities for their size.
- **Activity pattern**: Diurnal and highly active throughout the day. They are energetic climbers, chewers, and explorers who rarely sit still for long.
- **Social behavior**: Extremely social and pair-bonding. In the wild, they live in flocks and form strong pair bonds. A single bird requires significant daily interaction from its owner to remain tame and happy. Pairs bond intensely and may become less interested in human interaction. They can be aggressive toward other bird species and should not be housed with non-lovebird species.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird or pair. A larger flight cage of at least 75 cm (30") wide is strongly recommended.
- **Bar spacing**: 1-1.3 cm (3/8" to 1/2")
- **Setup**: Multiple perches of varying diameters, food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and abundant toys. Masked Lovebirds are vigorous chewers and need a constant supply of destructible toys -- wooden blocks, woven palm leaf toys, shredding materials, and leather strips. Swings and ladders are also appreciated.
- **Bathing**: They enjoy bathing. Provide a shallow bath dish or mist them regularly.
- **Flight space**: They are strong, agile flyers and benefit from flight cages or supervised out-of-cage time in a bird-safe room.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 50-60%). Small-sized formulated pellets are appropriate.
- **Seeds**: A quality small seed mix can supplement the diet (approximately 20-25%). They enjoy millet, canary seed, and small amounts of safflower and oat groats. Avoid excessive sunflower seeds due to high fat content.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens (kale, spinach, Swiss chard), carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, peas, corn, zucchini, and sweet potato.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of apple, berries, grapes, melon, mango, and papaya as treats.
- **Sprouted seeds**: Excellent nutritional supplement that mimics natural foraging.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Masked Lovebirds are extremely active and require ample exercise. Provide the largest enclosure possible and at least 2-3 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- They are avid chewers and need a rotating supply of destructible toys. Untreated wooden blocks, woven grass or palm toys, paper strips, and leather pieces are essential for beak health and mental stimulation.
- Foraging toys that require manipulation to access food are excellent for preventing boredom.
- Bathing is greatly enjoyed -- offer a shallow dish of water or gentle misting several times per week.
- Social interaction is critical. Single birds need daily handling and play with their owner. Pairs will entertain each other but still benefit from environmental enrichment.

## Common Health Issues
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection causing respiratory and systemic illness. Zoonotic.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial and fungal infections, including aspergillosis.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A and calcium deficiency from seed-only diets.
- **Obesity and fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Common with high-fat seed diets and insufficient exercise.
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus causing feather loss and immune suppression.
- **Polyomavirus**: Particularly dangerous in young birds, causing acute illness and feather abnormalities.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Single females may lay excessively, leading to calcium depletion and egg binding.
- **Feather plucking**: Can result from stress, boredom, hormonal imbalance, or medical issues.
- **Eye infections (conjunctivitis)**: The prominent eye-ring can be susceptible to irritation and infection.
- **Knemidokoptes mites (scaly face/leg mites)**: Causing crusty lesions on the beak, cere, and legs.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 10-12 months, though breeding is best delayed until approximately 1 year of age.
- **Clutch size**: 4-6 eggs, typically 4-5.
- **Incubation period**: 21-23 days. The female incubates primarily, with the male feeding her during this period.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 5-6 weeks (35-42 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 8-10 weeks after hatching.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 20 cm x 20 cm x 25 cm (8" x 8" x 10") with a 5-6 cm (2") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings, though the hen will often carry nesting material (bark strips, paper, leaves) into the box herself.
- Masked Lovebirds carry nesting material in their beaks (unlike peach-faced lovebirds, which tuck material into their rump feathers).
- They are generally reliable breeders in captivity and make good parents.
- Breeding pairs should be housed separately from other pairs to prevent aggression.
