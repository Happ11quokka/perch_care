# Cockatiel (*Nymphicus hollandicus*)

## Overview
The cockatiel is the second most popular pet bird in the world, surpassed only by the budgerigar. Native to Australia, cockatiels are the smallest members of the cockatoo family (Cacatuidae) and are the only species in the genus *Nymphicus*. They are beloved for their gentle temperament, distinctive crest, charming whistling ability, and relatively easy care requirements. Cockatiels have been bred in captivity since the mid-19th century and are available in numerous color mutations.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Cacatuidae (cockatoo family)
- **Origin**: Inland Australia (arid and semi-arid regions, often near water sources)
- **Size**: 30-33 cm (12-13 inches) from head to tail tip
- **Weight**: 75-125 g (approximately 2.6-4.4 oz); typical healthy weight is 80-100 g
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years in captivity; some individuals can live 25-30 years with excellent care

## Appearance
The wild-type (normal grey) cockatiel has a predominantly grey body with a prominent yellow face and erectile crest, bright orange cheek patches ("ear spots"), and a long tail. Males typically display brighter yellow faces and more vivid orange cheek patches, while females tend to have duller facial coloring with barring on the underside of the tail feathers.

Common color mutations include:
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with white wing patches, orange cheek spots, and red eyes. One of the most popular mutations.
- **Pearl**: Scalloped or spotted pattern on the back, wings, and chest.
- **Pied**: Patches of yellow or white randomly distributed across the grey body.
- **Cinnamon**: Warm brownish-grey replacing the normal grey coloration.
- **Whiteface**: Lacks yellow and orange pigmentation, resulting in a grey and white bird.
- **Albino**: Combination of whiteface and lutino, producing an all-white bird with red eyes.
- **Yellowface, Fallow, Silver**: Additional less common mutations.

## Temperament & Personality
Cockatiels are gentle, affectionate, and social birds that form strong bonds with their owners. They are often described as one of the most easygoing parrot species.

- **Noise level**: Moderate. Males are more vocal, producing a range of whistles, chirps, and calls. They can be loud at dawn and dusk. Overall, they are quieter than larger cockatoos.
- **Talking ability**: Limited vocabulary compared to budgies or larger parrots. Males are more likely to learn words, though cockatiels excel at whistling tunes and mimicking household sounds (phone rings, microwaves, etc.).
- **Trainability**: Very trainable and enjoy interaction. They readily learn to step up, whistle tunes, and perform simple tricks.
- **Body language**: The erectile crest provides valuable communication cues -- a raised crest indicates alertness or excitement, a flattened crest suggests fear or aggression, and a relaxed, slightly raised crest indicates contentment.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 60 cm x 45 cm x 60 cm (24" x 18" x 24") for a single bird; 90 cm (36") wide or larger is recommended given their long tail feathers.
- **Bar spacing**: 1.3-1.6 cm (1/2" to 5/8")
- **Setup**: Provide multiple perches of varying diameters (natural wood branches are ideal), food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and a variety of toys. Cockatiels enjoy swings and bells. The cage should be rectangular rather than round, as round cages can cause psychological stress.
- **Placement**: Position in a well-lit, draft-free area. Cockatiels are prone to night frights (thrashing in the cage at night), so a small nightlight near the cage can help prevent injuries.

### Diet
A balanced diet is critical for cockatiel health:
- **Pellets**: Should comprise approximately 60-70% of the diet. Formulated pellets ensure balanced nutrition and help prevent the selective eating common with seed diets.
- **Seeds**: Can be offered as a treat or supplement (no more than 20-30% of the diet). Cockatiels are naturally ground foragers and enjoy millet, canary seed, and small amounts of sunflower seed.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens, carrots, sweet potato, broccoli, bell peppers, corn, peas, and beans.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of apple, banana, berries, melon, and grapes as treats.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water must be available at all times.
- **Supplements**: Cuttlebone for calcium; vitamin supplements may be recommended by an avian veterinarian for birds on seed-based diets.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Cockatiels need daily out-of-cage time in a bird-safe environment (at least 1-2 hours).
- They enjoy foraging activities, shredding toys, and chewing softwood toys.
- Social interaction is essential -- cockatiels are flock animals and can become depressed if isolated.
- Provide opportunities for bathing through misting, a shallow dish, or placement near a gentle stream of water.
- Cockatiels enjoy music and may whistle along with tunes.

## Common Health Issues
Cockatiels are susceptible to several health conditions:

- **Chronic egg laying**: Very common in single female cockatiels. Excessive egg laying depletes calcium stores and can lead to egg binding, osteoporosis, and reproductive tract infections. Management includes reducing daylight hours to 10-12 hours, removing nesting stimuli, and dietary calcium supplementation.
- **Fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Common in birds on high-fat, seed-only diets. Causes obesity, overgrown beak, and liver failure.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial, fungal (particularly aspergillosis), and viral infections affecting the respiratory system.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Caused by *Chlamydia psittaci*, causing respiratory signs and lethargy. Zoonotic.
- **Polyomavirus**: Primarily affects young birds, causing feather abnormalities and organ failure.
- **Night frights**: Cockatiels are particularly prone to nocturnal panic episodes where they thrash violently in the cage, potentially causing injuries to wings, feet, and chest. A nightlight can help mitigate this.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A deficiency is common in seed-based diets, leading to respiratory and skin problems. Calcium deficiency contributes to egg binding and metabolic bone disease.
- **Gastrointestinal parasites**: Including roundworms and coccidia, particularly in aviary birds.
- **Feather cysts**: Abnormal feather growth where the feather curls beneath the skin, forming a lump.
- **Conjunctivitis and eye infections**: May be associated with vitamin A deficiency or bacterial infections.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 9-12 months, though breeding should ideally be delayed until 18 months.
- **Clutch size**: 4-6 eggs (can range from 2-8).
- **Incubation period**: 18-21 days. Both parents share incubation duties -- the male typically incubates during the day, the female at night.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 4-5 weeks of age and are weaned by 8-10 weeks.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm (12" x 12" x 12") with a 7-8 cm (3") entrance hole.
- Cockatiels are prolific breeders in captivity and may produce multiple clutches per year if not managed, which can be detrimental to the hen's health.
