# Pacific Parrotlet (*Forpus coelestis*)

## Overview
The Pacific parrotlet (also known as the celestial parrotlet or Lesson's parrotlet) is one of the smallest commonly kept parrot species in the world. Despite their diminutive size, Pacific parrotlets are true parrots with outsized personalities -- they are often described as "big birds in little bodies." Native to western Ecuador and northwestern Peru, these tiny parrots are bold, curious, and surprisingly feisty. They have grown significantly in popularity as companion birds due to their manageable size, relatively quiet nature (for a parrot), and engaging personalities.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Subfamily: Psittacinae)
- **Origin**: Western Ecuador and northwestern Peru, inhabiting dry tropical forests, scrubland, and degraded former forest areas along the Pacific coast
- **Size**: 11-14 cm (4.5-5.5 inches)
- **Weight**: 28-36 g (approximately 1-1.3 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15-20 years in captivity with proper care; some individuals have been reported to live over 25 years

## Appearance
Pacific parrotlets are sexually dimorphic (males and females can be visually distinguished). The wild-type male is predominantly green with a bright cobalt blue streak behind the eye extending to the nape, blue on the rump, and blue on the wing coverts. Females lack the blue markings or show only a faint blue-green tinge behind the eye. Both sexes have a short, somewhat wedge-shaped tail, a proportionally large head, and a small but sturdy beak.

Color mutations available in captivity include:
- **Blue**: The entire body is blue instead of green, with males showing darker blue markings.
- **American Yellow**: Yellow body replacing the green, with blue markings retained in males.
- **Lutino**: Yellow body with no blue markings and red eyes.
- **Albino**: White body with red eyes.
- **American White**: White body retaining some blue markings.
- **Turquoise**: Blue-green body coloration.
- **Fallow**: Diluted green-yellow with red eyes.
- **Dark factor**: Darker versions of green or blue.
- **Pied and Marbled**: Patches of reduced pigmentation.

## Temperament & Personality
Pacific parrotlets are known for their bold, confident, and sometimes stubborn personalities:

- **Noise level**: Low to moderate. They are one of the quieter parrot species, making them suitable for apartment living. Their vocalizations include soft chattering, chirps, and occasional squawking, but they lack the piercing screams of larger parrots.
- **Talking ability**: Moderate. Some individuals, particularly males, can learn a small vocabulary of words and phrases (typically 10-15 words). Their voice is small and somewhat buzzy but can be surprisingly clear.
- **Temperament**: Bold, fearless, and territorial. Pacific parrotlets do not seem to realize they are small and will stand up to much larger birds or animals. They can be nippy, particularly if not regularly handled. They tend to bond strongly with one person and may become aggressive toward others.
- **Single vs. paired**: A single parrotlet bonds more closely with its owner but requires daily handling to maintain tameness. A pair of parrotlets will bond with each other and may become less interested in human interaction. Introducing a second parrotlet to a single bird requires careful management, as aggression is common.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm (18" x 18" x 18") for a single bird, though larger is strongly recommended. Despite their small size, parrotlets are active and need room to move.
- **Bar spacing**: 0.8-1.3 cm (5/16" to 1/2"). Wider spacing risks escape or head entrapment.
- **Setup**: Multiple perches of varying diameters (natural wood preferred), food and water dishes, cuttlebone or mineral block, and plenty of toys. Parrotlets are enthusiastic chewers and need a steady supply of destructible toys (small wooden blocks, shreddable paper, small willow balls).
- **Safety note**: Parrotlets are very small and can get into tight spaces. Ensure there are no gaps where they can become stuck. Remove all potentially toxic items from the play area.

### Diet
- **Pellets**: Should form the base of the diet (approximately 60-70%). Use small or mini-sized pellets appropriate for their beak size.
- **Seeds**: A small seed mix can be offered as a supplement (no more than 15-20%). Parrotlets enjoy millet, canary seed, and small amounts of flax and hemp seed.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Offer daily -- dark leafy greens (kale, Swiss chard, dandelion greens), carrots, broccoli, bell peppers, peas, corn, and sweet potato.
- **Fresh fruits**: Small amounts of berries, apple, grapes, banana, and melon as treats.
- **Sprouted seeds**: Highly nutritious and enjoyed by parrotlets.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and fruit seeds/pits.
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times.
- **Note**: Despite their small size, parrotlets have a fast metabolism and should never go without food for extended periods.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Daily out-of-cage time is essential (at least 1-2 hours in a bird-safe room).
- Parrotlets are intelligent and need mental stimulation -- provide foraging toys, puzzle feeders, and rotate toys regularly.
- They enjoy climbing, hanging, and exploring. Small foot toys (beads, small balls) are popular.
- Supervised interaction is critical during out-of-cage time, as their small size makes them vulnerable to injury from stepping, ceiling fans, open doors/windows, and other household hazards.
- Bathing via gentle misting or a small dish is usually enjoyed.

## Common Health Issues
Pacific parrotlets are generally hardy birds but can be affected by:

- **Obesity and fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Can occur with high-fat seed diets and insufficient exercise. Parrotlets can become overweight quickly due to their small size.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Single females may lay excessively, leading to calcium depletion and egg binding.
- **Egg binding**: A medical emergency in which the hen cannot pass an egg. More common in calcium-deficient or overweight birds.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection with respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Respiratory infections**: Bacterial, viral, or fungal. Signs include nasal discharge, sneezing, tail bobbing, and labored breathing.
- **Trauma and injuries**: Due to their small size, parrotlets are at particular risk for injuries from falls, other pets, being stepped on, or flying into windows and mirrors. Clipping wing feathers can help in some cases but must be done carefully.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: Parrotlets are curious chewers and may ingest zinc or lead from cage hardware, jewelry, or household items.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Caused by avian bornavirus, affecting digestion and the nervous system.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin A deficiency from seed-only diets leads to respiratory and immune problems.
- **Polyomavirus**: Primarily affects young birds.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Around 8-12 months, though breeding is best delayed until at least 1 year old.
- **Clutch size**: 4-6 eggs.
- **Incubation period**: 18-22 days.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 4-5 weeks.
- **Weaning**: Complete weaning occurs around 6-8 weeks.
- **Nest box**: A small wooden nest box approximately 15 cm x 15 cm x 23 cm (6" x 6" x 9") with a 4-5 cm (1.5-2") entrance hole.
- Pairs should be monitored for aggression, as males can become aggressive toward females (or vice versa). Providing ample space and visual barriers can help.
- Hand-feeding chicks requires experience, as their small size makes the process challenging.
