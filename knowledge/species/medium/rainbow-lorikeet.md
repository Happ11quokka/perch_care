# Rainbow Lorikeet (*Trichoglossus moluccanus*)

## Overview
The Rainbow Lorikeet is a brilliantly colored, medium-sized parrot native to eastern and northern Australia, with populations also found in parts of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and various Pacific islands. Renowned for their vivid, rainbow-like plumage and exuberant personality, Rainbow Lorikeets are unique among companion parrots for their highly specialized nectar-feeding diet. They possess a specialized brush-tipped tongue adapted for extracting nectar and pollen from flowers. While they are entertaining, affectionate, and strikingly beautiful, their specialized dietary needs and messy feeding habits require dedicated care from experienced owners.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (Subfamily: Loriinae -- Lories and Lorikeets)
- **Origin**: Eastern and northern Australia (from South Australia to Cape York); also found in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and New Caledonia. Feral populations established in Perth, Auckland, Hong Kong, and other cities.
- **Size**: 25-30 cm (10-12 inches)
- **Weight**: 100-157 g (approximately 3.5-5.5 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 20-30 years in captivity with proper care; some individuals reported to live beyond 30 years

## Appearance
The Rainbow Lorikeet is one of the most colorful parrots in the world, with a vivid palette that fully justifies its common name. The head is deep violet-blue extending from the forehead to the nape and across the cheeks. The breast is bright red-orange with variable blue-black barring. A broad yellow-green collar separates the blue head from the green back and wings. The belly and thighs are deep green with yellow banding. The underwings show a bold red band. The tail is green above with yellow-olive on the underside. The beak is bright orange-red, the eyes are red-orange, and the legs are grey-green.

Sexual dimorphism is minimal. Males and females are virtually identical in plumage. Males may be very slightly larger with a marginally broader head, but visual sexing is unreliable. DNA sexing is recommended.

Subspecies and closely related species show regional color variations:
- **T. m. septentrionalis**: Slightly smaller with more greenish breast markings (northern Queensland)
- **T. haematodus** complex: Several closely related species formerly grouped as subspecies, including the Coconut Lorikeet and others across the Pacific

## Temperament & Personality
- **Noise level**: High. Rainbow Lorikeets are vocal and noisy birds. They produce frequent, loud, high-pitched screeching calls, chattering, and squawking, particularly during morning and evening. They are not suitable for noise-sensitive environments or apartment living without consideration for neighbors.
- **Talking ability**: Moderate to good. Many individuals learn to say words and short phrases clearly. They are enthusiastic vocalizers and often mimic sounds, whistles, and household noises.
- **Temperament**: Extremely playful, energetic, bold, and affectionate. They are often described as clownish and entertaining, constantly active and inquisitive. They bond strongly to their owners and enjoy being handled, carried, and cuddled. However, they can also be nippy and territorial, especially around their cage or food.
- **Activity pattern**: Diurnal and intensely active throughout the day. They are among the most high-energy parrot species kept as companions, constantly moving, playing, hanging upside down, and exploring.
- **Social behavior**: Highly social and flock-oriented. In the wild, they form large, noisy flocks. In captivity, they crave constant interaction and companionship. They can be aggressive toward other bird species and should generally be housed separately unless in a very large aviary.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
- **Minimum cage size**: 90 cm x 60 cm x 90 cm (36" x 24" x 36") for a single bird. A larger flight cage or aviary is strongly recommended due to their high energy and active nature.
- **Bar spacing**: 1.5-2 cm (5/8" to 3/4")
- **Setup**: The most critical consideration for lorikeet housing is their **liquid droppings**. Due to their nectar-based diet, Rainbow Lorikeets produce frequent, watery, projectile droppings that can spray outside the cage. Special measures are essential:
  - Use acrylic cage guards or splash panels around the lower half of the cage
  - Place the cage on easy-to-clean flooring (not carpet)
  - Use absorbent cage liners that are changed daily
  - Choose cages that are easy to disassemble and clean thoroughly
- Multiple perches including natural branches, food and water dishes, and toys. They enjoy swings, bells, and interactive toys.
- **Flight space**: They are agile, fast flyers and benefit enormously from flight cages, aviaries, or supervised free-flight time.

### Diet
Rainbow Lorikeets have a **highly specialized diet** that differs significantly from most other companion parrots. Their brush-tipped tongue is adapted for licking nectar and pollen, and their digestive system is designed for a primarily liquid/soft food diet.

- **Nectar / Lorikeet formula**: This is the dietary staple (approximately 50-60% of the diet). Commercial lorikeet nectar formulas are available in both wet (liquid) and dry (powder, mixed with water) forms. Reputable brands include Vetafarm, Passwell, and Wombaroo. Fresh nectar should be prepared daily and replaced every few hours in warm weather to prevent bacterial growth.
- **Fresh fruits**: A major component of the diet (approximately 25-30%). Offer daily: apple, pear, grapes, banana, mango, papaya, melon, berries, kiwi, orange, and stone fruits. Fruits should be chopped into manageable pieces.
- **Fresh vegetables**: Smaller component but still important -- corn on the cob, peas, broccoli, carrot (grated), bell peppers, and leafy greens.
- **Pollen**: Bee pollen granules can be sprinkled over fruit as a natural supplement that mimics their wild diet.
- **Flowers**: Safe edible flowers such as hibiscus, bottlebrush (*Callistemon*), grevillea, and eucalyptus blossoms provide natural nectar sources and enrichment.
- **Seeds and pellets**: Rainbow Lorikeets should **NOT** eat a standard seed or pellet diet. Their gizzard is relatively weak compared to seed-eating parrots, and dry seed diets can cause crop impaction, malnutrition, and other digestive problems. Some specially formulated lorikeet pellets (small and softened) may be offered in small amounts.
- **Avoid**: Avocado, chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, onion, garlic, and standard parrot seed mixes. Also avoid excessive iron-rich foods (see health section).
- **Water**: Fresh, clean water at all times. They drink frequently due to their liquid-heavy diet.

### Exercise & Enrichment
- Rainbow Lorikeets are extremely active and need extensive exercise. Provide the largest enclosure possible and at least 3-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- They are acrobatic and love to hang upside down, swing, and climb. Provide swings, ladders, ropes, and climbing structures.
- They adore bathing. Offer bathing opportunities daily -- a shallow dish of water, gentle misting, or even access to a running faucet or shower perch. Many lorikeets will bathe multiple times per day if given the opportunity.
- Foraging enrichment is important -- hide fruit pieces in foraging toys, offer edible flowers on branches, and provide opportunities to "work" for their food.
- Social interaction with their owner is essential. They thrive on play, physical contact, and interactive games.
- Due to their projectile droppings, have easily washable surfaces available during out-of-cage time.

## Common Health Issues
- **Iron storage disease (hemochromatosis)**: One of the most significant health concerns for lorikeets. Their digestive system is adapted to a low-iron diet, and excessive dietary iron accumulates in the liver, eventually causing organ damage and death. Avoid high-iron foods (spinach, meat, fortified foods) and ensure the commercial lorikeet formula is low-iron.
- **Nutritional problems from improper diet**: Feeding a standard seed or pellet diet to lorikeets causes severe malnutrition, digestive problems, and shortened lifespan. The specialized nectar diet is non-negotiable.
- **Bacterial and yeast infections (candidiasis)**: The high-sugar nectar diet creates an environment susceptible to crop candidiasis (yeast infections) if hygiene is poor or the bird's immune system is compromised.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Bacterial infection with respiratory and systemic signs. Zoonotic.
- **Aspergillosis**: Fungal respiratory infection.
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus infection, a significant concern in Australian parrots.
- **Crop impaction**: Can occur if the bird ingests too many seeds or dry, hard foods that its digestive system cannot handle.
- **Obesity**: Can develop from excessive fruit sugars or commercial nectar formulas that are overly concentrated.
- **Feather plucking**: Less common than in cockatoos but can occur due to stress, boredom, or medical issues.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Avian bornavirus infection affecting the digestive and nervous system.

## Breeding Information
- **Sexual maturity**: Approximately 18-24 months of age.
- **Clutch size**: 2 eggs, occasionally 3.
- **Incubation period**: 23-25 days. The female incubates primarily, with the male feeding her and guarding the nest.
- **Fledging**: Chicks leave the nest at approximately 7-8 weeks (49-56 days).
- **Weaning**: Chicks are fully weaned by approximately 10-12 weeks after hatching. Weaning lorikeets onto their specialized diet requires patience and proper nectar formula.
- **Nest box**: A wooden nest box approximately 25 cm x 25 cm x 40 cm (10" x 10" x 16") with a 7-8 cm (3") entrance hole. Line with untreated wood shavings or decayed wood.
- Rainbow Lorikeets breed readily in captivity when provided with appropriate nest boxes and a compatible pair.
- Both parents share chick-rearing duties. They are generally attentive parents.
- The chicks require hand-feeding with specialized lorikeet hand-rearing formula if parent-rearing is not successful.
- Breeding pairs should be housed individually to prevent aggression.
