# White-Bellied Caique (*Pionites leucogaster*)

## Overview
The White-Bellied Caique (pronounced "kai-EEK") is one of two caique species commonly kept as pets, and is widely regarded as one of the most playful and entertaining companion parrots. Often called the "clown of the bird world," the White-Bellied Caique is a medium-sized, stocky parrot known for its exuberant personality, acrobatic antics, and distinctive hopping behavior. These energetic birds bring joy and laughter to their owners but require committed caretakers who can match their high energy levels.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: South America -- found south of the Amazon River in Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru
- **Size**: Approximately 23--25 cm (9--10 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 150--170 grams; surprisingly heavy for their size
- **Lifespan**: Up to 30 years in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The White-Bellied Caique has a distinctive "sectioned" color pattern. The head is bright orange and yellow, the wings and back are green, the breast and belly are white (hence the name), and the thighs and flanks may display yellow or green tones. The beak is horn-colored (pinkish), distinguishing it from the Black-Headed Caique's black beak. The eyes are reddish-brown, and the legs and feet are pink.

The Yellow-Thighed Caique (*Pionites leucogaster xanthomeria*) is a subspecies of the White-Bellied Caique with more prominent yellow thighs, though it is less common in the pet trade.

The White-Bellied Caique has a stocky, compact build and is noticeably heavier than other birds of similar length. Juveniles are duller in coloration, with some brownish or greenish markings on the head, and develop full adult coloring as they mature.

## Temperament & Personality
White-Bellied Caiques are extraordinarily playful, energetic, and outgoing. They are known for their unique behaviors, including hopping and "surfing" (lying on their backs and rolling around), which delight their owners. These birds are highly social and thrive on interaction with their human companions. An excited caique may hop about on flat surfaces, a behavior rarely seen in other parrot species.

Despite their charming personality, caiques can be strong-willed and may become nippy if not properly socialized. They can also be territorial, particularly with other bird species. Caiques generally do best when housed with another caique rather than with different species.

**Noise level**: Moderate. While not as loud as Aratinga conures or cockatoos, caiques can produce shrill, piercing calls when excited or seeking attention. They tend to be noisier during periods of high energy.

**Talking ability**: Limited. White-Bellied Caiques are not known for their talking ability. They may learn a few words or phrases, but their strength lies in their personality and physical comedy rather than verbal communication. They can learn to mimic environmental sounds.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
White-Bellied Caiques need a large cage despite their relatively small stature due to their extremely active nature. A small aviary is ideal if space permits. The minimum recommended cage size is 24 inches long x 24 inches wide x 30 inches high, with bar spacing of 3/4 inch. The cage must be of quality construction (stainless steel is recommended), as caiques are clever and will quickly discover any weaknesses. A grating on the bottom of the cage is recommended. The cage should include multiple perches, swings, and an abundance of toys.

### Diet
A pelleted base diet supplemented with a generous variety of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended. Caiques enjoy nutrient-dense foraging foods that engage their busy beaks. Fresh fruits such as apples, bananas, grapes, and berries are readily accepted, as are vegetables like carrots, broccoli, peas, and leafy greens. Fresh water should always be available. Avoid avocado, chocolate, caffeine, and other toxic foods.

### Exercise & Enrichment
White-Bellied Caiques are among the most active of all parrot species and require extensive out-of-cage time and play opportunities. They enjoy wrestling, rolling, hopping, and playing with toys on flat surfaces. A play gym with ropes, swings, and climbing structures is essential. These birds benefit from a diverse selection of both destructible (wood, leather, paper) and indestructible (acrylic, stainless steel) toys. Foraging toys that require problem-solving are particularly valuable for mental stimulation.

## Common Health Issues
- **Polyomavirus**: Caiques can be susceptible to avian polyomavirus, especially as young birds. Vaccination may be available.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection; maintaining clean housing and good ventilation helps reduce risk.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition affecting the gastrointestinal and nervous systems.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus that affects feather and beak integrity.
- **Obesity**: Due to their stocky build and food enthusiasm, caiques can be prone to weight gain if overfed or given insufficient exercise.
- **Feather plucking**: While less common in caiques than in some other species, it can occur due to stress, boredom, or medical issues.
- **Leg injuries**: Their active, hopping behavior can sometimes lead to leg or foot injuries if the environment is not properly bird-proofed.

## Breeding Information
White-Bellied Caiques typically reach sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age. A sturdy nesting box approximately 10 x 10 x 12 inches should be provided for breeding pairs. The hen usually lays 2 to 4 eggs per clutch, with incubation lasting approximately 25 to 27 days. Chicks fledge at about 10 to 12 weeks of age. Caiques can be territorial during breeding season, and pairs should be housed separately from other birds.
