# Green-Cheeked Conure (*Pyrrhura molinae*)

## Overview
The Green-Cheeked Conure is one of the most popular small to medium-sized parrots kept as pets. Favored by both novice and experienced bird owners for its relatively affordable price, manageable size, affectionate temperament, and comparatively low noise level, this South American conure has become a staple in aviculture. It breeds readily in captivity, making it widely available in the pet trade.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: South America -- Brazil, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay
- **Size**: Approximately 25 cm (10 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 60--80 grams
- **Lifespan**: Up to 20 years in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The Green-Cheeked Conure is predominantly green with gray barring on the chest that fades into a slightly reddish belly. The tail feathers are maroon, and the flight feathers display blue coloring. The bird has a dark gray beak and feet. It is often confused with the closely related Maroon-Bellied Conure (*Pyrrhura frontalis*) due to their similar appearance, though the Green-Cheeked Conure is generally a bit brighter in color.

Numerous color mutations have been developed in captivity, including:
- **Pineapple**: A combination of yellow and cinnamon coloring
- **Yellow-sided**: Brighter yellow and red on the chest and sides
- **Cinnamon**: Lime green body with a lighter, paler overall color
- **Turquoise**: Blue-green plumage replacing the normal green

## Temperament & Personality
Green-Cheeked Conures are outgoing and comical, though they can be slightly shyer than other conure species. They are highly social birds that form strong bonds with their owners and require significant daily interaction and out-of-cage time. They are not known to be nippy and are particularly affectionate compared to many other parrot species.

**Noise level**: Low to moderate for a conure. They are among the quieter conure species, making them more suitable for apartment living than their Aratinga cousins.

**Talking ability**: Limited. Green-Cheeked Conures may learn a few words or phrases, but they are not known for their talking ability. They communicate more through body language and vocalizations.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A spacious cage is essential for these active birds. The minimum recommended cage size is 24 inches long x 24 inches wide x 30 inches high, with bar spacing of 1/2 to 5/8 inch. The cage should include multiple perches of varying diameters and textures, and a good rotation of toys to keep the bird entertained. Green-Cheeked Conures love to play and will appreciate climbing opportunities and foraging toys.

### Diet
A nutritionally balanced manufactured diet (high-quality pellets) should form the base of the diet, supplemented with fresh vegetables, fruits, and healthy table foods. Conures have busy beaks and benefit from foods that encourage foraging behavior, such as nutrient-dense foraging foods. Fresh water should always be available. Avoid avocado, chocolate, caffeine, and other foods toxic to birds.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Green-Cheeked Conures are active and playful birds that need daily out-of-cage time for exercise and social interaction. A play gym or play stand outside the cage provides a dedicated space for supervised activity. They enjoy a good rotation of chewable toys, climbing structures, and foraging opportunities. These birds thrive on interaction with their owners and can become unhappy if left alone for extended periods.

## Common Health Issues
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to boredom, stress, or lack of social interaction. Ensuring adequate enrichment and attention helps prevent this behavior.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition affecting the nerves of the gastrointestinal tract, causing weight loss and undigested food in droppings.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A viral disease that affects feather and beak growth.
- **Conure Bleeding Syndrome**: Linked to a deficiency in vitamin K, which can cause sudden bleeding episodes.
- **Respiratory infections**: Including aspergillosis, a fungal infection that can develop in birds kept in unsanitary or poorly ventilated conditions.
- **Pacheco's disease**: A herpesvirus infection that can be fatal in conures.

## Breeding Information
Green-Cheeked Conures breed fairly easily in captivity, which contributes to their widespread availability. They typically reach sexual maturity at around 1 to 2 years of age. A standard nesting box should be provided for breeding pairs. The hen typically lays 4 to 6 eggs, which are incubated for approximately 22 to 25 days. Chicks fledge at about 7 to 8 weeks of age. If keeping a pair, both birds can maintain their pet quality with regular attention from their owners.
