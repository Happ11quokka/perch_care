# Quaker Parrot / Monk Parakeet (*Myiopsitta monachus*)

## Overview
The Quaker Parrot, also known as the Monk Parakeet, is one of the most popular medium-sized parrots due to its wide availability, relatively low cost, and outstanding mimicking ability. Native to South America, this resourceful species has established large feral populations across North America and Europe, making itself a charming -- if sometimes controversial -- addition to urban landscapes. The Quaker Parrot holds the unique distinction of being the only parrot species that builds its own stick nest rather than nesting in tree cavities.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Argentina and neighboring countries in subtropical South America; feral populations established in North America, Europe, and elsewhere
- **Size**: Approximately 29--30 cm (11--12 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 90--120 grams
- **Lifespan**: Up to 30 years in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The wild-type Quaker Parrot is primarily bright green with a grey face, throat, and upper breast. The lower breast and abdomen display pale grey barring. The flight feathers are blue, and the tail is long and green with blue outer feathers. The beak is horn-colored, and the eyes are dark brown.

Several color mutations have been developed in captivity:
- **Blue**: Pale blue replacing the green, with a lighter grey breast
- **Lutino**: Yellow with white markings
- **Pallid (dilute)**: Lighter, washed-out version of the normal green
- **Cinnamon**: Warm cinnamon tones replacing the green
- **Albino**: All-white plumage

Quaker Parrots are not sexually dimorphic; males and females appear identical and require DNA testing for reliable sex determination.

## Temperament & Personality
Quaker Parrots are social, intelligent, and highly entertaining birds. Their most distinctive behavioral feature is their namesake "quaking" -- a bobbing and shaking motion that appears abnormal but is entirely natural and unique to this species. They are social animals that appreciate human companionship or the company of other Quakers. They can become depressed and neurotic if left alone too often.

Quaker Parrots are known for their strong personalities and can be quite willful. A pair of Quakers will bond while still maintaining their relationship with their owners if given consistent attention and inclusion in family life. They are also voracious chewers and will quickly destroy furniture if not provided with appropriate chew toys.

**Noise level**: High. Despite their small size, Quaker Parrots are quite vocal and can be noisy enough to wake the soundest sleepers and disturb neighbors. They are particularly vocal in the morning and evening.

**Talking ability**: Excellent. Quaker Parrots are among the best talkers of any parrot species relative to their size, rivaling African Greys and Amazons in mimicking ability. They often begin talking at a young age and can develop extensive vocabularies.

**Legal note**: Quaker Parrots are illegal to own in some U.S. states and cities due to the threat feral populations pose to agriculture and native bird species. Prospective owners should check local regulations before acquiring one.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A minimum cage size of 24 inches long x 24 inches wide x 24 inches high is recommended, with bar spacing of 5/8 to 3/4 inch. The cage should be sturdy and well-constructed, as Quakers are intelligent and may learn to open cage doors. Plenty of chewable toys and safe branches are essential, as these birds will redirect their destructive tendencies onto household items if not provided with appropriate alternatives. A play gym outside the cage is recommended.

### Diet
A nutritionally balanced pellet-based diet should be supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and healthy table foods. Quaker Parrots enjoy a variety of foods and can be offered leafy greens, carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, and cooked grains. Fresh water should always be available. A good calcium source, such as a cuttlebone, should be provided.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Quaker Parrots are active, energetic birds that require daily out-of-cage time. They are natural builders and enjoy constructing nests from any available material, so providing safe weaving materials can be an excellent enrichment activity. Foraging toys, puzzle feeders, and a rotation of chewable toys help keep these intelligent birds mentally stimulated. Regular social interaction is essential, as these birds thrive on companionship.

## Common Health Issues
- **Fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: One of the most common health issues in Quaker Parrots, typically caused by a high-fat, seed-only diet and lack of exercise.
- **Feather plucking and self-mutilation**: Can result from boredom, stress, or lack of social interaction; this species is particularly prone to these behaviors if neglected.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection that can cause respiratory symptoms and is transmissible to humans.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system.
- **Pacheco's disease**: A herpesvirus infection that can be fatal.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection related to poor hygiene.
- **Egg binding**: Can occur in breeding females or those laying eggs without a mate.

## Breeding Information
Quaker Parrots are unique among parrots in building elaborate stick nests rather than using tree cavities. In the wild, their twig-built nests can be massive, multi-chambered structures. In captivity, they may be reluctant to use standard breeding boxes but will often accept them if provided with twigs and substantial nesting material. They typically lay 6 to 8 eggs per clutch, though clutches of up to 13 viable eggs have been recorded. Incubation lasts approximately 24 days, and chicks fledge at about 6 weeks of age. Sexual maturity is typically reached at 1 to 2 years.
