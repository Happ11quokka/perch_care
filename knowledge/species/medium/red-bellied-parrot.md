# Red-Bellied Parrot (*Poicephalus rufiventris*)

## Overview
The Red-Bellied Parrot, also known as the Abyssinian Parrot or Red-Breasted Parrot, is a member of the Poicephalus family of African parrots. Endemic to East Africa, this species is gaining popularity in the pet trade for its inquisitive, sweet personality and notably good talking ability -- the best among all Poicephalus species. The Red-Bellied Parrot is one of the few Poicephalus species that is visually sexually dimorphic, with males displaying the distinctive red-orange belly that gives the species its name.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: East Africa -- central Ethiopia south to the Pangani district of northeastern Tanzania
- **Size**: Approximately 22 cm (8.5--8.8 inches) in length; adults may reach 8 to 10 inches when fully mature
- **Weight**: 120--150 grams
- **Lifespan**: 20 to 30 years in captivity; potentially longer with excellent care

## Appearance
The Red-Bellied Parrot is similar in shape to the Senegal Parrot but slightly larger. The head, wings, and back are greyish-brown. The lower back has a blue tinge though it is predominantly yellow-green. The breasts, under-wing coverts, and cheeks are washed with orange, and the thighs and under-wing coverts are aqua green. The bird has wide eye rings, red irises, a black bill, and dark grey feet.

**Sexual dimorphism**: This is one of the most easily sexed Poicephalus species by visual inspection. Adult males display a distinctive red-orange belly, while females have a green abdomen. However, young birds of both sexes may show some orange coloration on the belly, making sexing of immatures less reliable. Immatures are generally duller overall with shorter tails and develop adult plumage at approximately 12 months of age.

**Subspecies**: Two subspecies are recognized:
- *P. r. rufiventris* (nominate): Central Ethiopia to northeastern Tanzania
- *P. r. pallidus* (Somalia Red-Bellied Parrot): Eastern Ethiopia and Somalia; similar to the nominate but with paler greyish-brown on the head and upper breast

The species is listed as CITES Appendix II due to its endangered status in its natural habitat.

## Temperament & Personality
Captive-bred and hand-raised Red-Bellied Parrots generally have inquisitive, sweet, and confiding personalities. They are easily tamed and tend to be calmer and quieter than many other parrot species. They are said to be somewhat quieter than most parrots, producing a variety of sounds both learned and instinctive. These birds can be affectionate and enjoy spending time with their owners.

Like other Poicephalus species, Red-Bellied Parrots can be shy or phobic if not properly socialized. Positive, respectful interactions are important to build trust and prevent fear-based behaviors.

**Noise level**: Low to moderate. Red-Bellied Parrots are among the quieter parrot species, consistent with the Poicephalus family's reputation.

**Talking ability**: Good -- the best of the Poicephalus family. While not all individuals will learn to talk, with patient and consistent training, many can develop a reasonable vocabulary. They are more likely to talk than Senegal or Meyer's Parrots.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A minimum cage size of 20 inches long x 20 inches deep x 24 inches high is recommended, with bar spacing of 5/8 to 3/4 inch. As with all Poicephalus species, a cage with horizontal bars is preferred to facilitate climbing. The cage should include natural wood perches, a variety of toys, and food and water dishes. A play gym or stand outside the cage is recommended for daily out-of-cage time.

### Diet
A high-quality pelleted diet should be supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted seeds. In the wild, Red-Bellied Parrots eat seeds, fruits, blossoms, and insects. Captive birds benefit from a varied diet including leafy greens, carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, and cooked legumes. A quality small parrot seed mix can be offered as a supplement. Provide fresh water at all times.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Red-Bellied Parrots are active birds that enjoy climbing and playing. Daily out-of-cage time is important for both physical exercise and social bonding. Provide a variety of toys including climbing structures, ropes, ladders, and chewable items. Foraging toys provide valuable mental stimulation. These birds should receive 10 to 12 hours of undisturbed sleep per night. Bathing opportunities should be offered regularly.

## Common Health Issues
- **Aspergillosis**: A common fungal disease in Poicephalus parrots. Maintaining clean housing, balanced nutrition, and a stress-free environment helps reduce risk.
- **Bornavirus / Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition causing weight loss and poor digestion despite eating.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection causing respiratory distress and lethargy; transmissible to humans.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus affecting feather and beak integrity.
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, or medical issues. Proper enrichment and socialization help prevent this.
- **Calcium deficiency and egg binding**: Particularly a concern for breeding females.
- **Fatty liver disease**: Can develop with improper diet high in fat and low in fresh produce.

## Breeding Information
Red-Bellied Parrots typically do not breed until 3 to 4 years of age. For best breeding results, they should be housed in a quiet, protected aviary with a nesting box measuring approximately 10 x 10 x 14 inches (25 x 25 x 35 cm) with a 3-inch entrance hole. The hen usually lays 4 to 6 eggs at two-day intervals. Incubation is carried out by the hen and lasts approximately 27 to 28 days. Chicks fledge at about 45 to 50 days. After fledging, the male continues to care for the young. Chicks are typically independent at 12 to 14 weeks of age.
