# Eastern Rosella (*Platycercus eximius*)

## Overview
The Eastern Rosella, also known as the Golden-Mantled Rosella, is a strikingly colorful parrot native to southeastern Australia and Tasmania. One of eight rosella species, the Eastern Rosella is one of the two most commonly kept in captivity (alongside the Crimson Rosella). Known for their vivid multicolored plumage and pleasant whistling calls, Eastern Rosellas are often kept in aviaries but can also make rewarding companion birds when hand-raised and regularly socialized. They have been introduced to New Zealand, where feral populations are now established.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (tribe Platycercini)
- **Origin**: Southeastern Australia and Tasmania; introduced to New Zealand
- **Size**: 28--32 cm (11--12.8 inches) in length, with an average of 30 cm (11.8 inches)
- **Weight**: Approximately 99 grams (3.5 oz) on average
- **Lifespan**: Up to 25 to 30 years with proper care

## Appearance
The Eastern Rosella is one of the most colorful parrots. The head, upper breast, and under-tail coverts are bright red. The cheeks are white -- a distinctive feature. The lower breast is yellow, transitioning to yellowish-green on the abdomen, with fine dark edging on the feathers. The nape, back, and shoulder feathers are black with yellowish-green edging, creating a scalloped pattern. The bend of the wing and outer wing coverts are blue, and the flight feathers also display blue. The middle tail feathers are dark green with a narrow dark blue edging, while the outer tail feathers are pale blue with a dark blue base and pale tips. The bill is light grey-horn, the eye rings are narrow grey to dark grey, the irises are dark brown, and the feet are grey.

**Sexual dimorphism**: Females are on average smaller than males, with duller red coloring and a narrower bill. The green edging on back feathers may also appear duller in females. Many females display a whitish under-wing stripe that is absent in most males. However, sexing young birds can be difficult, and DNA testing may be the only reliable method until approximately 9 months of age when they begin molting into adult plumage.

Immature birds are similar to females but have duller plumage overall, with a green back of the crown and nape. They attain adult coloration after their second molt, at approximately 12 to 16 months of age, when they also become sexually mature.

## Temperament & Personality
Eastern Rosellas tend to be more independent than many other parrot species. While they may not be as inclined to cuddle or seek petting like cockatoos or conures, a well-socialized, hand-tamed rosella can be a sociable and charming companion. They are generally best suited to aviary life with others of their kind but will retain their pet quality in a flighted situation if regularly interacted with. A hand-fed rosella may calmly sit on its owner's shoulder during meals, and the dinner table can be a good opportunity for bonding.

**Noise level**: Low to moderate. Rosellas can produce loud chatter, particularly in the morning and evening, but they are not among the loudest parrot species.

**Talking ability**: Very limited. Eastern Rosellas are not great talkers and may learn only a few simple words at best. However, they are excellent whistlers and can learn to whistle entire tunes. Playing whistled music for your rosella can result in delightful "playback" of the melodies.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
The largest cage possible is recommended, though bar spacing must be appropriate for their head size (typically 1/2 to 5/8 inch). An aviary setup is ideal for Eastern Rosellas, where they can fly freely and live peacefully with others of their kind in a sufficiently large space. For a single indoor bird, a minimum cage size of 36 inches long x 24 inches wide x 36 inches high is recommended. Include a variety of perches and a shallow dish of water for bathing, as rosellas love to bathe.

### Diet
A good rosella diet should include a quality cockatiel seed mix with added canary seed, supplemented with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Suitable fresh foods include apples, blackberries, oranges, cucumbers, sweet potatoes, mangoes, kale, and boiled egg. Sprouted or germinated seeds are an excellent nutritional addition and are often more easily accepted by seed-focused birds than fresh produce. Sprouted seeds are lower in fat and higher in vegetable proteins, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and chlorophyll. A pelleted diet can also be incorporated. Fresh water should always be available.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Eastern Rosellas need space for flying and active movement. An aviary setting that allows flight is the ideal arrangement. If kept in a cage, the bird should be given ample out-of-cage time for flight exercise. Rosellas enjoy foraging on the ground (a natural behavior in the wild), so scattering food on a clean surface can provide enrichment. They appreciate bathing opportunities and should have access to a shallow water dish or gentle spray. Toys and natural branches provide additional stimulation.

## Common Health Issues
- **Fungal infections**: Rosellas may be more susceptible to fungal infections, particularly when housed in outdoor aviaries where they forage on the ground. Maintaining clean enclosures is essential.
- **Intestinal worm infections**: A significant concern for aviary-housed birds, especially those in outdoor settings with ground-level foraging. Regular fecal testing and deworming protocols are important.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: Rosellas are prone to this bacterial infection, which causes respiratory symptoms and is transmissible to humans. Quarantine new birds and maintain good hygiene.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus that can affect feather and beak health.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection; proper ventilation and cleanliness help prevent it.
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Can occur in birds fed a seed-only diet without adequate fresh produce supplementation.

## Breeding Information
In their natural habitat, the breeding season is influenced by rainfall and location. In the northern parts of their range, they usually breed from September to January, while southern populations breed from February to June. In captivity in the Northern Hemisphere, they mostly breed from April through September.

The courting male bows forward low on the perch while sounding mating calls; the interested female reciprocates. This is followed by mutual feeding and mating. Wild rosellas nest near water in the cavities of dead or living trees. In captivity, a standard nesting box should be provided. The hen typically lays 4 to 7 eggs, with incubation lasting approximately 19 to 20 days. Chicks fledge at about 5 weeks. Young birds reach sexual maturity at approximately 12 to 16 months, when they attain full adult plumage after their second molt.
