# Alexandrine Parakeet (*Psittacula eupatria*)

## Overview
The Alexandrine Parakeet is one of the largest parakeet species, named after Alexander the Great, who is credited with exporting numerous specimens from Punjab into European and Mediterranean countries where they were treasured as prized possessions of nobles and royalty. The scientific name *eupatria* derives from Latin and Greek, meaning "of noble ancestry." These striking, intelligent birds combine the elegance of the Psittacula genus with a larger, more robust build.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (subfamily Psittaculinae)
- **Origin**: South and Southeast Asia, including India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and parts of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam
- **Size**: Approximately 58 cm (23 inches) in total length, with a wingspan of 19--21.5 cm (7.5--8.5 inches); the Nepalese subspecies (*P. e. nipalensis*) can reach 62 cm (24.5 inches)
- **Weight**: 250--260 grams (8.75--9.1 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 25 to 30 years or more in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The Alexandrine Parakeet is a large, elegant bird predominantly green in color with a blue-grey sheen on the cheeks and nape, particularly in males. The abdomen is yellowish-green. A distinctive bold maroon (reddish-brown) patch is present at the top of the wing coverts (the "shoulder patch") in all birds regardless of age, sex, or subspecies. The tail is long with blue-green upper middle feathers and a yellow underside. The upper and lower mandibles are red with yellow tips. The irises are yellowish-white in adults, and the periopthalmic rings are light grey.

**Sexual dimorphism**: Adult males (3 years and older) display a distinctive pitch-black neck ring with a large pink nape band. Females may show grey neck ring shadows but never display true black feathers in the ring. Immature birds of both sexes resemble adult females and have shorter tails. Full adult feathering is typically acquired between 18 and 30 months of age, though it may appear as early as 12 months or as late as 36 months.

**Subspecies**: Five subspecies are recognized, differing mainly in plumage details and size:
- *P. e. eupatria* (nominate) -- 58 cm
- *P. e. nipalensis* (Nepalese) -- 62 cm, the largest genuine parakeet species in the world
- *P. e. magnirostris* (Andaman Islands) -- slightly larger than nominate with a more massive beak
- *P. e. avensis* (Indo-Burmese) -- same size as nominate with yellowish-green head and nape
- *P. e. siamensis* (Siamese/Laos) -- 56 cm, the smallest subspecies

## Temperament & Personality
Alexandrine Parakeets are intelligent, independent, and can be very affectionate when properly socialized. They tend to be somewhat more reserved than Indian Ringnecks but bond deeply with their primary caregiver. Like their Ringneck cousins, they go through a "bluffing" phase during adolescence that requires patience and consistent handling. Well-socialized Alexandrines can be playful and gentle, though they may become one-person birds without broad socialization.

**Noise level**: Moderate to high. Alexandrines can produce loud calls, especially in the morning and evening. Their larger size gives them a louder voice than their Indian Ringneck relatives.

**Talking ability**: Good. Alexandrine Parakeets are capable talkers that can develop a reasonable vocabulary. Their voice tends to be clearer and less harsh than many other parrot species.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Due to their large size and long tail, Alexandrine Parakeets require a spacious cage. The minimum recommended cage size is 36 inches long x 24 inches wide x 36 inches high, though larger or an aviary setting is ideal. Bar spacing should be 3/4 to 1 inch. The cage should include sturdy perches of various diameters and numerous toys. Horizontal bars facilitate climbing. A play stand or gym outside the cage is essential for daily exercise.

### Diet
A high-quality pellet-based diet should be supplemented with a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted seeds. Alexandrines enjoy apples, grapes, carrots, corn, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes. A small parrot seed mix can be offered in limited amounts. Nuts can be provided as occasional treats. Fresh water should always be available. Adequate calcium supplementation is important, especially for breeding females.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Alexandrine Parakeets are active birds that require daily out-of-cage time and substantial mental stimulation. They enjoy chewing, climbing, and solving puzzles. A variety of durable toys, including wooden chew toys, foraging toys, and ropes, should be provided and rotated regularly. Regular training sessions and social interaction help maintain their bond with their owner and prevent behavioral issues.

## Common Health Issues
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection common in Psittacula species; symptoms include respiratory distress, lethargy, and nasal discharge.
- **Polyomavirus**: A viral disease especially dangerous to young birds, causing feather abnormalities and organ failure.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection; good hygiene and proper ventilation help reduce the risk.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus affecting feather and beak growth.
- **Fatty liver disease**: Can occur in birds on a high-fat, seed-heavy diet with insufficient exercise.
- **Bacterial infections**: Various bacterial infections can affect the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.
- **Feather plucking**: Can result from stress, boredom, hormonal changes, or underlying medical conditions.

## Breeding Information
Alexandrine Parakeets typically reach sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age, though the male's full neck ring may not develop until 3 years. A large nesting box (approximately 14 x 14 x 24 inches) with a 4-inch entrance hole should be provided. The hen usually lays 2 to 4 eggs, and incubation lasts approximately 26 to 28 days. Chicks fledge at about 7 to 8 weeks. Alexandrines can be prolific breeders when provided with appropriate conditions.
