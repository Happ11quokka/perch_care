# Jenday Conure (*Aratinga jandaya*)

## Overview
The Jenday Conure (sometimes spelled "Jendaya") is one of the most common medium-sized conures, ranking just below the Sun Conure in popularity. A member of the Aratinga genus, the Jenday is known for its vibrant coloring, charismatic personality, and strong social bonding. These birds are an excellent choice for those who want the personality of a large parrot in a more manageable size. The Jenday Conure is believed to be the closest living relative of the now-extinct Carolina Parakeet.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Northeastern Brazil, in wooded habitats
- **Size**: Approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 115--130 grams
- **Lifespan**: Up to 20 years or more in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The adult Jenday Conure has a bright orange and yellow head, a green body, and blue-tipped flight feathers. The breast transitions from orange to yellowish-green on the abdomen. The bird has a black beak and dark eyes with white eye rings. Juveniles are primarily green with mottled yellow heads and do not develop their full adult coloration until approximately 2 years of age. The Jenday is the same general shape and size as the Sun Conure, but its body is primarily green rather than the Sun Conure's predominantly yellow-orange.

The Jenday Conure is not sexually dimorphic, making visual sexing unreliable. DNA testing is the most accurate method for determining sex.

## Temperament & Personality
Jenday Conures have a reputation for being somewhat more laid-back than other conures, though they still require and expect plenty of interaction with their human companions. They are highly social, intelligent, and affectionate birds that form strong bonds with their owners. With daily attention, even paired Jendays will maintain their pet quality.

**Noise level**: Moderate to high. Like other Aratinga conures, Jendays can produce loud calls, particularly in the morning and evening. They are not as loud as Sun Conures but are still notable vocalizers.

**Talking ability**: Limited. Jenday Conures may learn a few words, but they are better known for their calls and whistles than their talking ability.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
An adequately sized cage is essential, with minimum dimensions of 36 inches long x 24 inches wide x 24 inches high. Although similar in size to a cockatiel, the Jenday Conure will not be happy in a cockatiel-sized cage. Confining a bird of this energy level to an inadequate cage can lead to self-mutilation and behavioral problems. Bar spacing should be 3/4 inch or less. A play gym and play stand with places to hang rope and toys is strongly recommended.

### Diet
A nutritionally balanced pellet-based diet supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and healthy table foods. Jenday Conures are not picky eaters, which makes offering a varied diet easier. Fresh water should be available at all times. Avoid avocado, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Jenday Conures are active, energetic birds that require daily out-of-cage time for exercise and interaction. They are notorious chewers and need plenty of wooden toys and safe branches to satisfy their chewing instincts. Indestructible toys made from acrylic, lava, and hard plastic can supplement the toy rotation but should make up a smaller percentage of toys offered. A solid swing made of tough material is also a great addition to the cage.

## Common Health Issues
- **Feather plucking**: Often caused by boredom, stress, or inadequate social interaction.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract, causing weight loss and poor digestion.
- **Conure Bleeding Syndrome**: Linked to vitamin K deficiency, resulting in spontaneous bleeding.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus that affects feather and beak development.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection; proper cage hygiene and ventilation help reduce the risk.
- **Chlamydiosis (Psittacosis)**: A bacterial infection transmissible to other birds and humans.
- **Self-mutilation**: Can result from confinement in an inadequately sized cage or lack of enrichment.

## Breeding Information
Jenday Conures are readily bred in captivity. They typically reach sexual maturity at approximately 2 years of age. A standard nesting box should be provided for breeding pairs. The hen usually lays 3 to 5 eggs per clutch, with incubation lasting approximately 23 to 26 days. Chicks fledge at about 7 to 8 weeks of age. While Jendays can be paired with Sun Conures or other Aratinga species for companionship, breeding between different species is strongly discouraged to maintain genetic integrity.
