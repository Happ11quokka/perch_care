# Meyer's Parrot (*Poicephalus meyeri*)

## Overview
The Meyer's Parrot, also known as the Brown Parrot, is a member of the Poicephalus family of African parrots. These gentle, undemanding birds have gained steady popularity as companion parrots due to their quiet nature, sweet disposition, and manageable size. While less well-known than their Senegal Parrot cousins, many aviculturists consider Meyer's Parrots to have an even milder temperament, making them excellent pets for apartment dwellers and first-time parrot owners seeking a calm companion.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: Sub-Saharan Africa -- widely distributed across central and eastern Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Botswana, Namibia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo
- **Size**: Approximately 21--23 cm (8--9 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 100--135 grams
- **Lifespan**: 25 to 35 years in captivity; some individuals may live longer with excellent care

## Appearance
Meyer's Parrots have a predominantly brownish-grey to dark brown plumage on the head, back, and wings, with turquoise or blue-green markings on the rump, lower back, and wing coverts. The breast and abdomen display varying amounts of green and turquoise. Many individuals show yellow markings on the crown, bend of the wing ("shoulders"), and thighs, though the extent of yellow varies between subspecies and individuals. The beak is dark grey to black, and the eyes are reddish-orange in adults.

**Subspecies**: Six subspecies are recognized, varying primarily in the extent of yellow markings:
- *P. m. meyeri* (nominate)
- *P. m. saturatus*
- *P. m. matschiei*
- *P. m. reichenowi*
- *P. m. damarensis*
- *P. m. transvaalensis*

Males and females are virtually identical in appearance, and DNA testing is required for reliable sex determination.

## Temperament & Personality
Meyer's Parrots are generally sweet-natured, calm, and well-mannered. A well-socialized Meyer's has a personality quite similar to the Senegal Parrot, though many owners describe them as slightly milder and less prone to nippy behavior. Hand-raised individuals are friendly, affectionate, and playful, enjoying being the center of attention.

It is important to socialize Meyer's Parrots with the entire family from a young age, as they may otherwise bond exclusively to one person. These birds adapt readily to new surroundings when young but become less flexible as adults. They are generally not demanding and can keep themselves entertained with toys for periods during the day, though they still require regular social interaction.

**Noise level**: Low. Meyer's Parrots are among the quietest parrot species, making them an ideal choice for apartment dwellers. Their natural vocalizations include soft screeches, and when alarmed they may growl, escalating to shrieking cries.

**Talking ability**: Limited. Meyer's Parrots may learn to say a few words and can mimic environmental sounds, but they are not known as strong talkers. Within the Poicephalus family, the Red-Bellied Parrot is generally considered the best talker.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A minimum cage size of 20 inches long x 20 inches deep x 18 inches high is required, though ideally the cage should be closer to 40 inches long x 20 inches deep x 32 inches high with bar spacing of 5/8 to 3/4 inch. Since Meyer's Parrots love to climb, cages with horizontal bars on at least two sides are best. The cage should include natural wood perches of varying diameters, a grooming perch, plenty of toys (love swings and boings are favorites), and food and water dishes. A play gym outside the cage provides a safe space for supervised out-of-cage time.

### Diet
A high-quality pelleted diet supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted seeds forms the foundation of a healthy Meyer's Parrot diet. Their natural diet includes fruits, berries, flowers, seeds, nuts, and occasional insects. In captivity, offer a variety of fresh produce including leafy greens, carrots, sweet potatoes, apples, berries, and cooked legumes. A quality small parrot seed mix can supplement the pellet base. Fresh water and bathing opportunities should always be available, as Meyer's Parrots enjoy bathing.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Meyer's Parrots are active climbers and players that require daily out-of-cage time. They need 10 to 12 hours of undisturbed sleep each day. Climbing is a favorite activity, so provide ropes, ladders, and perches both inside and outside the cage. A variety of chewable and interactive toys should be available, with favorites including love swings and boings. Regular bathing opportunities should be provided, as many Meyer's Parrots enjoy water -- offer a shallow bathing dish or a gentle shower.

## Common Health Issues
- **Aspergillosis**: A common fungal disease in Poicephalus parrots. Clean housing, a balanced diet, and a low-stress environment help prevent it.
- **Bornavirus / Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Symptoms include weight loss despite eating and undigested food in droppings.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection causing respiratory symptoms; transmissible to humans.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A viral disease affecting feather and beak health.
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, or hormonal changes, though Meyer's Parrots are less prone to this than some other species.
- **Fatty liver disease**: Can develop with a high-fat, seed-heavy diet and insufficient exercise.
- **Calcium deficiency**: Important to monitor, especially in breeding females.

## Breeding Information
Meyer's Parrots typically reach sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age. A nesting box approximately 10 x 10 x 14 inches with a 3-inch entrance hole should be provided. The hen usually lays 3 to 4 eggs, with incubation lasting approximately 26 to 28 days. Chicks fledge at about 8 to 9 weeks and are weaned by approximately 12 to 14 weeks. Adult males may become more aggressive during breeding season. A roosting box may be appreciated year-round, as it provides warmth and security.
