# Senegal Parrot (*Poicephalus senegalus*)

## Overview
The Senegal Parrot is the best-known and most popular member of the Poicephalus family of African parrots. These compact, playful birds are prized for their relatively quiet nature, manageable size, and charming personalities. With their striking tri-color plumage and stocky build, Senegal Parrots have been popular companion birds for decades. They were heavily imported from Africa until importation became illegal in 1992, and today they are widely bred in captivity.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: West Africa -- Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, and the Central African Republic
- **Size**: 23--26 cm (9--10 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 110--170 grams (3.9--6.0 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 20 to 30 years in captivity; some individuals have been recorded living close to 50 years

## Appearance
The Senegal Parrot has a distinctive tri-colored appearance: a charcoal grey head, green wings, back, and throat, and a V-shaped "vest" of yellow to orange on the breast and abdomen. The upper breast is bright green, transitioning into the colorful vest below. The eye color ranges from silvery yellow to orange in adults, while immature birds have dark eyes. The beak is dark grey to black.

**Three subspecies** are recognized, differentiated primarily by the color of the abdomen:
- *P. s. senegalus* (nominate): Yellow abdomen -- the most common in the pet trade
- *P. s. mesotypus* (Reichenow's Orange-bellied): Paler overall with a deeper orange abdomen
- *P. s. versteri* (Red-vented): Darker green upperparts with a deep orange-red abdomen

**Gender identification**: Males and females look virtually identical. However, some visual cues may suggest sex: the female's V-shaped vest tends to extend further down between the legs, while the male's V typically ends higher on the chest. Males generally have a flatter crown and larger beak and head, while females have a more rounded crown and slightly smaller beak. DNA testing is the most reliable method of sex determination. Rare yellow and pied color mutations have occurred in captivity.

## Temperament & Personality
Senegal Parrots are known for their playful, affectionate, and somewhat comical personalities. They tend to be quieter than many other parrot species, making them suitable for apartment living. While they can be outgoing and social, they may also be somewhat shy or phobic in unfamiliar situations. A well-socialized Senegal Parrot makes an excellent companion, but they can become one-person birds if not introduced to and handled by multiple family members.

These birds appreciate having their heads and necks scratched but may not always seek cuddling. They enjoy climbing and playing independently with toys but also require regular interaction with their owners.

**Noise level**: Low to moderate. Senegal Parrots are among the quieter parrot species, which is a significant advantage for those living in close quarters with neighbors.

**Talking ability**: Limited to moderate. While not known as exceptional talkers, Senegal Parrots can learn to mimic some words and sounds. Red-bellied Parrots are generally considered the best talkers of the Poicephalus family.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
A minimum cage size of 20 inches long x 20 inches deep x 28 inches high is recommended, with bar spacing of 5/8 to 3/4 inch. Since Poicephalus parrots love to climb, choose a cage with horizontal bars that facilitate climbing. The cage should include a variety of perches, ropes, ladders, and toys. A play gym or stand outside the cage provides additional exercise space.

### Diet
A high-quality pelleted diet should form the base, supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted seeds. In the wild, Senegal Parrots eat a variety of seeds, fruits, blossoms, and even insects. Captive birds benefit from offerings such as apples, grapes, carrots, peas, leafy greens, and cooked legumes. A quality small parrot seed mix can be offered in limited amounts as a supplement. Fresh water should always be available.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Senegal Parrots are active birds that love to climb and play. Daily out-of-cage time is essential for physical exercise and social interaction. They enjoy rope toys, ladders, swings, and foraging toys. Climbing is a particularly important form of exercise for Poicephalus species. Provide a variety of chewable and interactive toys and rotate them regularly to prevent boredom.

## Common Health Issues
- **Aspergillosis**: A common fungal disease in Poicephalus parrots. Good husbandry, clean housing, a balanced diet, and a low-stress environment help minimize the risk.
- **Bornavirus / Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Signs include weight loss despite eating and poorly digested food in droppings.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection with respiratory symptoms that is transmissible to humans.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus affecting feathers and beak.
- **Feather plucking**: Can occur due to stress, boredom, or hormonal issues.
- **Calcium deficiency**: Particularly in breeding females, leading to egg binding or brittle bones.
- **Fatty liver disease**: Can develop in birds on high-fat, seed-heavy diets.

## Breeding Information
Senegal Parrots typically reach sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age. A nesting box approximately 10 x 10 x 14 inches with a 3-inch entrance hole should be provided. The hen usually lays 3 to 4 eggs, with incubation lasting approximately 25 to 28 days. Chicks fledge at about 9 weeks of age and are typically weaned by 12 to 14 weeks. Adult males may become more aggressive during breeding season. These birds are regularly bred in captivity and are widely available in the pet trade.
