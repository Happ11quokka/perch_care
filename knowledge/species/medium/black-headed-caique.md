# Black-Headed Caique (*Pionites melanocephalus*)

## Overview
The Black-Headed Caique (pronounced "kai-EEK") is one of two caique species commonly kept as companion birds. Like its close relative the White-Bellied Caique, the Black-Headed Caique is celebrated as one of the most playful, energetic, and entertaining parrots available. Often referred to as the "clown of the bird world," these medium-sized, stocky parrots are known for their acrobatic antics, hopping behavior, and irrepressible enthusiasm. The Black-Headed Caique is distinguished from the White-Bellied by its striking black crown and darker beak.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: South America -- found north of the Amazon River in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela
- **Size**: Approximately 23--25 cm (9--10 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 150--170 grams; notably heavy for their size
- **Lifespan**: Up to 30 years in captivity with proper care

## Appearance
The Black-Headed Caique features a distinctive black cap on the top of its head, contrasting with bright orange-yellow cheeks and throat. The nape is orange-yellow, the wings and back are green, and the breast and belly are white to cream-colored. The thighs and flanks are yellow. A key distinguishing feature from the White-Bellied Caique is its black beak (versus the horn-colored beak of the White-Bellied). The eyes are reddish-orange, and the legs and feet are grey.

Like the White-Bellied Caique, the Black-Headed has a stocky, compact build and is surprisingly heavy for its length. Juveniles display duller coloration with some brown replacing the black on the crown, and the orange areas may be less vivid. Full adult coloring develops gradually.

## Temperament & Personality
Black-Headed Caiques share the exuberant, clownish personality that characterizes the caique genus. They are extraordinarily playful, energetic, and outgoing birds that seem to have an endless capacity for fun. Their signature behaviors include hopping on flat surfaces, lying on their backs and playing with toys, and engaging in enthusiastic wrestling with their owners' hands. They are highly social and demand significant interactive time with their owners.

Caiques can be strong-willed and territorial. They may be aggressive toward other bird species and are generally best housed with another caique if a companion bird is desired. Proper socialization from a young age is important to prevent nippiness.

**Noise level**: Moderate. Black-Headed Caiques are not among the loudest parrot species, but they can produce shrill, high-pitched calls, especially when excited or attention-seeking. Their vocalizations include whistles, squeaks, and alarm calls.

**Talking ability**: Limited. Black-Headed Caiques are not noted for their speaking ability. They may learn a handful of words or phrases and can mimic some environmental sounds, but their primary appeal lies in their physical expressiveness and comedic antics rather than verbal communication.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Black-Headed Caiques require a spacious, sturdy cage to accommodate their high-energy lifestyle. A small aviary is ideal if space allows. The minimum cage size is 24 inches long x 24 inches wide x 30 inches high, with bar spacing of 3/4 inch. The cage should be constructed of quality materials (stainless steel is preferred) because caiques are adept at finding and exploiting structural weaknesses. Include multiple perches at different heights, a variety of toys, and a grating at the bottom of the cage.

### Diet
A high-quality pelleted base diet supplemented with generous amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables is recommended. Caiques are enthusiastic eaters and enjoy a wide variety of foods including apples, bananas, grapes, mangoes, carrots, broccoli, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens. Foraging-type foods that encourage beak activity are particularly beneficial. Fresh water should always be available. Limit high-fat seeds and nuts to treats only, as caiques can be prone to obesity.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Black-Headed Caiques are among the most energetic parrot species and need extensive daily out-of-cage time with supervised play. A large play gym with ropes, ladders, swings, and flat surfaces for hopping is essential. These birds need a constant supply of both chewable (wood, leather, paper, coconut shell) and durable (acrylic, stainless steel) toys. Foraging toys and puzzle feeders provide important mental stimulation. Social interaction with their owners is non-negotiable -- a bored caique can develop behavioral problems.

## Common Health Issues
- **Polyomavirus**: Caiques can be susceptible to avian polyomavirus, particularly as juveniles.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory disease; good cage hygiene and ventilation are important preventive measures.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: A viral condition caused by avian bornavirus, affecting the gastrointestinal and nervous systems.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus that compromises feather and beak health.
- **Obesity**: Caiques' stocky build and hearty appetites predispose them to weight gain without proper diet management and exercise.
- **Feather plucking**: Less common than in some species but can occur in response to stress, boredom, or medical issues.
- **Leg and foot injuries**: Their active hopping and acrobatic behavior can occasionally lead to injuries in unsafe environments.

## Breeding Information
Black-Headed Caiques typically reach sexual maturity at 2 to 3 years of age. A sturdy nesting box measuring approximately 10 x 10 x 12 inches with a 3-inch entrance hole should be provided. The hen lays 2 to 4 eggs per clutch, with incubation lasting approximately 25 to 27 days. Chicks develop slowly compared to many other parrot species and fledge at about 10 to 12 weeks. Both parents participate in rearing the young. Breeding pairs can be territorial and should be housed away from other birds.
