# Sun Conure (*Aratinga solstitialis*)

## Overview
The Sun Conure is one of the most popular and visually striking medium-sized parrots, renowned for its brilliant plumage of vivid yellows and oranges. Native to South America, this bird is prized for its stunning appearance, playful personality, and strong bonding nature. However, prospective owners should be aware that the Sun Conure is also one of the louder conure species.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae
- **Origin**: South America -- northeastern Brazil, Venezuela, and Guyana
- **Size**: Approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in length
- **Weight**: 100--120 grams
- **Lifespan**: 15 to 25 years in captivity with proper nutrition and veterinary care

## Appearance
The adult Sun Conure displays predominantly bright orange and yellow plumage, often with splotches of green on the wings and back. The bird has a black beak, prominent white eye rings, and a long tapering tail. The striking coloration develops gradually -- young birds are primarily green and do not reach their full adult coloration until approximately two years of age.

Sun Conures are not sexually dimorphic; males and females look virtually identical. Males are said to be slightly brighter, with squarer, flatter heads, while females may have rounder, slightly smaller heads. However, DNA sexing is the only reliable method for determining sex.

## Temperament & Personality
Sun Conures are bold, expressive, and adventurous birds with outgoing personalities. They are highly social and revel in their owner's attention. A Sun Conure will not thrive if left alone for extended periods and will benefit from a companion bird if the owner is frequently away. They are affectionate and enjoy physical contact, including cuddling and head scratches.

**Noise level**: High. Sun Conures are well known for their loud vocalizations, particularly their piercing screams. They can be heard from a considerable distance and may not be suitable for apartment living or households with noise sensitivity.

**Talking ability**: Limited to moderate. While Sun Conures can learn a few words and phrases, they are not considered strong talkers. They communicate more through loud calls and body language.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Sun Conures need a spacious cage to accommodate their active nature. A minimum cage size of 24 inches long x 24 inches wide x 30 inches high is recommended, though larger is always better. Bar spacing should be 3/4 inch or less. The cage should be equipped with multiple perches, swings, and a variety of toys. A play gym or play stand outside the cage is highly recommended for daily out-of-cage exercise.

### Diet
A nutritionally balanced pellet-based diet should be supplemented with a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. Sun Conures have busy beaks and enjoy foraging-type foods. Fresh water should always be available. Breeding females and pet birds laying eggs without a mate are prone to egg binding and calcium deficiency, so adequate calcium supplementation is important.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Sun Conures are active, playful birds that require daily out-of-cage time for exercise and social interaction. They enjoy climbing, swinging, and chewing. A good selection of destructible and indestructible toys should be rotated regularly to prevent boredom. Foraging toys that require problem-solving are especially beneficial.

## Common Health Issues
- **Feather plucking**: Frequently related to boredom, lack of social interaction, or dietary deficiencies. Confinement to an inadequately sized cage can also contribute.
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Caused by avian bornavirus; symptoms include weight loss despite eating and undigested food in droppings.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A viral condition causing abnormal feather growth and beak deformities.
- **Conure Bleeding Syndrome**: Related to vitamin K deficiency, causing sudden bleeding episodes.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection associated with poor hygiene or ventilation.
- **Egg binding and calcium deficiency**: Particularly in breeding females or those laying eggs without a mate.
- **Chlamydiosis (Psittacosis)**: A bacterial infection that can be transmitted to humans.

## Breeding Information
Sun Conures breed readily in captivity and are easily bred by experienced aviculturists. They reach sexual maturity at around 2 years of age. A nesting box approximately 12 x 12 x 12 inches should be provided. The hen typically lays 3 to 5 eggs, with incubation lasting about 23 to 27 days. Chicks fledge at approximately 7 to 8 weeks. Hybridization with related Aratinga species such as the Jenday Conure is possible but is discouraged, as it taints the already limited gene pool of this species, which is classified as endangered in the wild.
