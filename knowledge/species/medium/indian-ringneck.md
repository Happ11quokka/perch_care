# Indian Ringneck Parakeet (*Psittacula krameri*)

## Overview
The Indian Ringneck Parakeet, also known as the Rose-Ringed Parakeet or Ring-Necked Parakeet, is one of the most elegant and widely recognized medium-sized parrots. With a long history as a companion bird dating back thousands of years, the Indian Ringneck has established itself across the globe, with feral populations thriving in numerous countries. These intelligent, beautiful birds are known for their exceptional talking ability and the distinctive neck ring displayed by mature males.

## Basic Information
- **Family**: Psittacidae (subfamily Psittaculinae)
- **Origin**: Southern India and Sri Lanka; feral populations now exist worldwide including parts of Europe, North America, Africa, the Middle East, Japan, and Australia
- **Size**: 36--43 cm (14--17 inches) in total length, including a long tail that accounts for roughly half the total length; wing length 15--18 cm (6--7 inches)
- **Weight**: 115--140 grams (4--5 oz)
- **Lifespan**: 15 to 30 years in captivity; average lifespan approximately 15 years

## Appearance
The Indian Ringneck Parakeet is a slender, medium-sized parrot with a characteristically long, tapered tail. The wild-type coloration is apple green with a yellowish-green or bluish tinge on the underside. The upper beak is orangey-red with a black tip, and the lower bill is blackish with a paler tip. The irises are pale yellow, and the legs are greenish-slate.

This species is sexually dimorphic in adults. Mature males (typically by 3 years of age) display a distinctive black and rose-pink neck ring (collar), which is absent in females and immature birds. Females may show a faint shadow of a ring.

A wide range of color mutations has been developed in captivity, including:
- **Lutino**: Bright buttercup yellow with a red beak
- **Blue**: Powder blue plumage replacing the green
- **Albino**: White plumage with red eyes
- **Turquoise**: Blue-green intermediate coloring
- **Violet**: Deep purple-blue coloring
- **Cinnamon**: Warm cinnamon-toned green

## Temperament & Personality
Indian Ringnecks are intelligent, curious, and can develop charming personalities when properly socialized. However, they require consistent handling and ongoing obedience training. If not given sufficient attention and socialization, they can become unfriendly and aloof. These birds go through a "bluffing" phase during adolescence (typically around 4 months to 1 year of age) during which they may nip, hiss, and resist handling. Patient, consistent training through this phase typically results in a well-adjusted adult bird.

**Noise level**: Moderate. Indian Ringnecks are not as loud as Aratinga conures or cockatoos, but they can produce sharp, high-pitched calls, particularly in the morning and evening. Their noise level is generally manageable for most living situations.

**Talking ability**: Excellent. Indian Ringnecks are among the best talkers of the medium-sized parrots. They can develop extensive vocabularies of over 200 words and speak with remarkable clarity. They also enjoy mimicking sounds and whistling tunes.

## Care Requirements

### Housing
Indian Ringnecks need a spacious cage to accommodate their long tail feathers. The minimum recommended cage size is 24 inches wide x 24 inches deep x 36 inches high, though larger is preferable. Bar spacing should be 1/2 to 5/8 inch. The cage should have horizontal bars to facilitate climbing. Multiple perches of varying diameters and materials, along with a variety of toys, should be provided. A play stand or gym outside the cage is highly recommended.

### Diet
A high-quality pellet-based diet should form the foundation, supplemented with a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. Indian Ringnecks enjoy apples, grapes, spinach, watercress, dandelion greens, carrots, corn, peas, endives, and sweet potatoes. Sprouted seeds are an excellent nutritional supplement. A quality small parrot seed mix can be offered in limited amounts. Fresh water should always be available.

### Exercise & Enrichment
Indian Ringnecks are active, intelligent birds that require daily out-of-cage time and mental stimulation. They enjoy puzzle toys, foraging opportunities, and learning tricks. Regular training sessions strengthen the bond with their owner and provide necessary mental exercise. These birds appreciate a variety of chewable and interactive toys, and the toy selection should be rotated regularly.

## Common Health Issues
- **Polyomavirus**: Indian Ringnecks can be susceptible to avian polyomavirus, which is particularly dangerous to young birds.
- **Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)**: A bacterial infection that can cause respiratory symptoms, lethargy, and discharge; transmissible to humans.
- **Aspergillosis**: A fungal respiratory infection related to poor hygiene or ventilation.
- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: A circovirus affecting feather and beak integrity.
- **Bacterial infections**: Ring-necked parakeets can be susceptible to various bacterial infections, especially if their diet or hygiene is inadequate.
- **Fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: Can occur in birds fed a high-fat, seed-only diet without adequate exercise.
- **Feather plucking**: May develop due to stress, boredom, hormonal imbalances, or medical issues.

## Breeding Information
Indian Ringnecks breed readily in captivity. They typically reach sexual maturity at 1 to 3 years of age, with the male's neck ring fully developing by approximately 3 years. A nesting box approximately 12 x 12 x 18 inches with a 3-inch entrance hole should be provided. The hen usually lays 3 to 6 eggs, with incubation lasting approximately 22 to 24 days. Chicks fledge at about 6 to 7 weeks. Indian Ringnecks are prolific breeders, and numerous color mutations have been established through selective breeding programs.
