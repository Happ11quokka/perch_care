# Bumblefoot (Pododermatitis)

## Overview

Bumblefoot, or pododermatitis, is an inflammatory and often infectious condition of the plantar surface (bottom) of the foot in parrots. The condition begins as mild reddening or thinning of the foot pad skin and can progress through stages to deep infection involving tendons, joints, and bone. Bumblefoot is classified in stages from mild (Grade I) to severe (Grade V), with increasing tissue damage and difficulty of treatment at each stage. It is one of the most common foot problems in captive birds and is closely linked to husbandry and environmental factors.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop bumblefoot, but it is most common in heavier-bodied species such as Amazon parrots, cockatoos, macaws, and African grey parrots. Overweight birds and those with limited perching options are at the highest risk. Budgerigars and cockatiels can also be affected, particularly if perching surfaces are inappropriate.

## Causes

- **Inappropriate perches**: Smooth, dowel-type perches of uniform diameter do not allow the bird to shift pressure points on the foot, causing chronic pressure on the same areas.
- **Obesity**: Excess weight increases pressure on the foot pads.
- **Inactivity**: Sedentary birds that sit in one position for prolonged periods.
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Impairs skin integrity and immune function, predisposing to infection.
- **Poor hygiene**: Dirty perches contaminated with fecal material.
- **Trauma**: Cuts, puncture wounds, or abrasions on the foot pad.
- **Wire cage floors**: Constant pressure from wire mesh on the feet.
- **Arthritis**: Joint pain causing the bird to shift weight abnormally.
- **Previous injury**: Leg or foot injury causing the bird to favor one foot.

## Symptoms

### Grading System
- **Grade I**: Mild reddening and thinning of the plantar skin. No infection.
- **Grade II**: Redness, swelling, and early scab formation. Mild discomfort.
- **Grade III**: Visible ulceration or abscess with a central scab. Infection present. Lameness evident.
- **Grade IV**: Deep infection involving tendons. Significant swelling and pain. Obvious lameness.
- **Grade V**: Deep infection reaching bone (osteomyelitis) or joints (septic arthritis). Severe lameness and systemic illness.

### General Symptoms
- Redness and swelling of the foot pad
- Scab or callus formation on the plantar surface
- Shifting weight between feet or favoring one foot
- Reluctance to perch
- Lameness or limping
- Decreased activity
- Curled toes or abnormal foot posture
- Loss of appetite in severe cases

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Careful inspection of the plantar surface of both feet, grading the lesion severity.
- **Culture and sensitivity**: Swab of any exudate for bacterial culture to guide antibiotic selection. *Staphylococcus aureus* is the most commonly isolated organism.
- **Radiographs**: To assess for bone involvement (osteomyelitis) in advanced cases.
- **Cytology**: Examination of exudate for inflammatory cells and bacteria.
- **Blood work**: To assess systemic health if infection is severe.

## Treatment

Treatment is guided by the grade of the lesion:

- **Grade I-II (Early)**:
  - Change perches to natural wood branches of varying diameter and texture.
  - Add padded perches (rope or veterinary wrap-covered perches).
  - Apply topical treatments such as silver sulfadiazine cream or chlorhexidine.
  - Address weight management and diet.
  - Supplement vitamin A if deficient.

- **Grade III (Moderate)**:
  - All of the above, plus systemic antibiotics based on culture results.
  - Wound debridement under sedation.
  - Bandaging with topical antibiotics (ball bandage technique).
  - Regular bandage changes (every 2-3 days).

- **Grade IV-V (Severe)**:
  - Aggressive surgical debridement under general anesthesia.
  - Long-term systemic antibiotics (may require weeks to months).
  - Intensive bandage management.
  - Pain management with meloxicam.
  - If osteomyelitis is present, prolonged antibiotic therapy or toe/foot amputation may be necessary.
  - Supportive care and nutritional optimization.

## Prevention

- Provide a variety of natural wood perches of different diameters and textures (manzanita, java wood, natural branches).
- Keep perches clean and replace them regularly.
- Maintain a healthy body weight through proper diet and exercise.
- Feed a balanced diet with adequate vitamin A.
- Avoid smooth dowel or sandpaper-covered perches as the sole perching option.
- Do not use wire cage flooring.
- Encourage activity and exercise.
- Inspect feet regularly during handling.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is excellent for Grade I and II bumblefoot with appropriate husbandry changes. Grade III responds well to antibiotics and bandaging with a good prognosis. Grade IV carries a guarded prognosis and requires prolonged treatment. Grade V with osteomyelitis is difficult to treat and carries a poor prognosis; amputation may be necessary. Early detection and correction of husbandry factors are the keys to successful management.
