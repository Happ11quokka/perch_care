# Angel Wing

## Overview

Angel wing, also known as slipped wing, airplane wing, or drooped wing, is a developmental deformity in which the flight feathers on one or both wings twist and point outward rather than lying flat against the body. The condition results from abnormally rapid growth of the flight feathers relative to the supporting wing structures, causing the weight of the growing feathers to twist the carpal (wrist) joint outward. Angel wing develops during the rapid growth phase in young birds and is directly linked to excessive dietary protein and caloric intake. If detected and treated early, the condition can be corrected, but once skeletal maturation occurs, the deformity becomes permanent.

## Affected Species

Angel wing is most commonly documented in waterfowl (geese and ducks), but it can also occur in young parrots, particularly those that are hand-fed and overfed. Species reported to develop angel wing in captivity include macaws, cockatoos, and other large parrot species. Birds that grow rapidly on high-calorie, high-protein diets are most susceptible.

## Causes

- **Excess dietary protein**: The primary cause. Diets too high in protein accelerate feather growth beyond what the developing wing structures can support.
- **Excess calories**: Overfeeding or calorie-dense diets contribute to abnormally rapid growth.
- **Nutritional imbalance**: Disproportionate protein-to-energy ratios in hand-feeding formulas.
- **Rapid growth rate**: Any factor that accelerates growth beyond the normal rate for the species.
- **Genetic predisposition**: Some individuals may be more susceptible than others.
- **Insufficient exercise**: Young birds that do not exercise their wings adequately during development may be at higher risk.

## Symptoms

- Flight feathers on one or both wings curve outward away from the body
- The wing tip droops or sticks out at an abnormal angle
- The carpal (wrist) joint appears rotated or displaced outward
- Affected feathers may appear twisted or irregular
- The bird cannot fold the wing tightly against the body
- Inability to fly (in fully developed cases)
- The deformity is typically noticeable during the pin feather growth stage

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Visual inspection reveals the characteristic outward rotation of the wing at the carpal joint with flight feathers pointing away from the body.
- **Age assessment**: The condition is identified during the feather growth period in young birds.
- **Dietary history**: Review of the diet to identify excessive protein or caloric intake.
- **Radiographs**: May show rotation or deformity of the carpal joint, though diagnosis is primarily clinical.
- **Bilateral vs. unilateral**: Assessment of whether one or both wings are affected.

## Treatment

**Early treatment is essential.** The condition can only be corrected during the active growth phase:

- **Dietary correction**: Immediately reduce protein and caloric intake to species-appropriate levels. Switch to a properly formulated hand-feeding diet if the bird is still hand-feeding.
- **Wing wrapping**: The affected wing is gently positioned in the correct anatomical alignment and taped or wrapped in place using a figure-of-eight bandage or veterinary wrap. This holds the growing feathers in the proper position while the wing structures develop.
- **Duration of wrapping**: The wrap is typically maintained for 1-3 weeks, with regular removal to check progress and skin health. The wrap must be changed every few days.
- **Exercise**: Once the wrap is removed, encourage gentle wing flapping exercises to strengthen the wing muscles.
- **Feather trimming**: In some cases, trimming the heavy flight feathers reduces the mechanical force contributing to the twist.
- **Monitoring**: Regular veterinary follow-up to assess progress and adjust treatment.

**In adult birds with permanent deformity:**
- The condition cannot be corrected once skeletal maturation is complete.
- Surgical intervention has been attempted with variable results.
- Management focuses on quality of life, as the bird will be unable to fly.

## Prevention

- Feed species-appropriate diets with correct protein and calorie levels during the growth period.
- Follow hand-feeding formula manufacturer guidelines precisely; do not add extra ingredients.
- Avoid supplementing hand-feeding formula with additional protein sources.
- Monitor growth rate against species-specific growth charts.
- Encourage wing exercise in developing chicks through appropriate play and flapping opportunities.
- Consult with an avian veterinarian about proper nutrition for growing chicks.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is excellent if angel wing is detected and treated early during the growth phase, with most birds achieving full correction with dietary adjustment and wing wrapping. If the condition is not identified until after skeletal maturation, the prognosis for correction is poor and the deformity will be permanent. Affected birds that cannot fly can still live healthy lives with appropriate environmental accommodations, but their quality of life in terms of mobility and exercise will be diminished.
