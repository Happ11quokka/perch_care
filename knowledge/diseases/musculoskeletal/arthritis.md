# Arthritis in Parrots

## Overview

Arthritis in parrots refers to inflammation of one or more joints, resulting in pain, swelling, and reduced mobility. It encompasses both infectious arthritis (septic arthritis) caused by bacterial invasion of the joint, and non-infectious arthritis including degenerative joint disease (osteoarthritis) and gout-related arthritis. As companion parrots now commonly live to advanced ages, degenerative arthritis has become an increasingly recognized condition. Arthritic birds often suffer silently, as parrots instinctively mask pain, making observant ownership and regular veterinary monitoring essential for early detection.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop arthritis. Degenerative arthritis is most common in older, larger parrots such as macaws, cockatoos, and Amazon parrots. Gout-related arthritis (articular gout) is frequently seen in budgerigars and cockatiels. Septic arthritis can affect any species at any age.

## Causes

### Degenerative Arthritis (Osteoarthritis)
- Age-related wear and tear on joints
- Previous trauma or fractures involving the joint
- Obesity placing excess stress on joints
- Chronic bumblefoot altering weight-bearing patterns
- Inadequate exercise

### Septic (Infectious) Arthritis
- Bacterial infection (*Staphylococcus*, *E. coli*, *Mycobacterium*) spreading to joints via bloodstream or direct penetration
- Extension of bumblefoot infection into foot joints
- Wound contamination

### Articular Gout
- Kidney disease causing elevated uric acid levels
- Uric acid crystal deposition in joint spaces
- Dehydration and renal insufficiency
- High-protein diets (particularly in species that do not tolerate high protein)

## Symptoms

- Reluctance to perch or frequent shifting of weight between feet
- Favoring one leg or lameness
- Swollen, warm, or enlarged joints
- Decreased activity and reluctance to climb
- Difficulty gripping with feet
- Sleeping on the cage floor rather than on a perch
- Irritability or biting when feet or legs are handled
- Reduced appetite
- White, chalky deposits visible in or around joints (gout)
- Fluffed feathers and general malaise in septic arthritis

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation of joints to assess swelling, warmth, range of motion, and pain response.
- **Radiographs**: Show joint space narrowing, bone remodeling, periarticular swelling, or mineral deposits (gout). Essential for assessing the extent of joint damage.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count (elevated WBC in infection), chemistry panel (uric acid levels for gout, kidney function parameters).
- **Joint aspirate**: Aspiration of joint fluid for cytology, crystal analysis (uric acid crystals in gout), and bacterial culture.
- **Culture and sensitivity**: If septic arthritis is suspected.

## Treatment

### Degenerative Arthritis
- **Anti-inflammatory therapy**: Meloxicam is the primary NSAID used in avian patients for pain and inflammation.
- **Weight management**: Diet adjustment and exercise to reduce joint stress.
- **Environment modification**: Provide wide, padded perches at lower levels to reduce climbing. Add ramps and platforms. Place food and water at easily accessible heights.
- **Physical therapy**: Gentle range-of-motion exercises prescribed by the veterinarian.
- **Nutraceuticals**: Omega-3 fatty acids and glucosamine supplements may provide supportive benefit.
- **Heat therapy**: Gentle warmth applied to affected joints.

### Septic Arthritis
- **Systemic antibiotics**: Based on joint fluid culture and sensitivity.
- **Joint lavage**: Flushing the infected joint under anesthesia.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam for pain and swelling.
- **Supportive care**: Fluids, nutrition, and rest.

### Articular Gout
- **Allopurinol**: Reduces uric acid production.
- **Colchicine**: May be used to manage acute gout flares.
- **Fluid therapy**: To support kidney function and promote uric acid excretion.
- **Dietary modification**: Reduce dietary protein levels.
- **Address underlying kidney disease**: Essential for long-term management.
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam for comfort.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, species-appropriate diet to maintain healthy weight and kidney function.
- Provide varied perch sizes and textures to promote foot health.
- Ensure adequate exercise and activity.
- Provide UVB lighting and calcium for bone health.
- Treat bumblefoot and foot injuries promptly to prevent joint extension.
- Ensure adequate water intake to support kidney function.
- Schedule regular veterinary examinations, especially for aging birds.

## Prognosis

Degenerative arthritis can be managed but not cured; with appropriate pain management and environmental modification, affected birds can maintain a good quality of life. Septic arthritis carries a fair prognosis when treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics. Articular gout carries a guarded prognosis, as it indicates underlying kidney disease that is often progressive. Early intervention and ongoing management are key to maintaining comfort and mobility.
