# Constricted Toe Syndrome

## Overview

Constricted toe syndrome is a condition primarily affecting neonatal and very young parrots in which one or more toes become constricted by a band of dried tissue, thread, fiber, or shed skin that wraps tightly around the toe. The constriction cuts off blood circulation to the toe distal to the band, causing swelling, ischemia, and eventual necrosis. If not treated promptly, the affected toe can be lost entirely. The condition is most commonly seen in hand-raised chicks in dry environments and is considered a husbandry-related problem in many cases.

## Affected Species

Constricted toe syndrome is most commonly seen in macaw chicks (especially Eclectus parrots, African grey parrots, and various macaw species). Other psittacine species can be affected, particularly those raised in artificial incubation and hand-feeding environments. The condition is rare in parent-raised chicks.

## Causes

- **Low humidity**: Insufficient humidity in the brooder or nesting environment causes shed skin and tissue to dry and constrict around the toes.
- **Thread or fiber wrapping**: Loose threads from nesting material, towels, fabric liners, or rope can become wrapped around toes.
- **Dried food or formula**: Hand-feeding formula that dries on the feet and toes can create constricting bands.
- **Dried fecal material**: Feces that dries and hardens around the toes.
- **Constriction rings from shed skin**: Retained epithelial tissue that forms a tight ring as the chick grows.
- **Possible nutritional factors**: Some aviculturists believe biotin deficiency or other nutritional imbalances may play a role, though this is not definitively proven.
- **Nesting substrate issues**: Inappropriate or abrasive nesting materials.

## Symptoms

- Visible thread, fiber, or tissue ring constricting one or more toes
- Swelling of the toe distal to the constriction (the toe tip becomes bulbous)
- Discoloration of the toe (initially dark red, progressing to purple or black)
- The chick may bite at or favor the affected foot
- Reduced use of the affected foot
- Toe appears cold compared to unaffected digits
- Dry, necrotic tissue at the constriction site
- Loss of the toe tip if circulation is not restored

## Diagnosis

- **Visual examination**: Careful inspection of all toes under magnification reveals the constricting band. A magnifying glass or loupe is helpful.
- **Assessment of circulation**: Evaluating blood flow distal to the constriction by gently compressing the toe tip and observing capillary refill.
- **Identification of the constricting material**: Determining whether the band is thread, dried skin, or dried food/feces.
- **Evaluation of all toes**: Multiple toes may be affected simultaneously.

## Treatment

Treatment must be initiated immediately upon detection:

- **Remove the constricting material**: Using fine-tipped scissors, a scalpel blade, or a needle under magnification, carefully cut and remove the constricting band. This must be done with extreme care to avoid damaging the underlying tissue or blood vessels.
- **Soak the foot**: If the constricting material is dried food, formula, or feces, soak the foot in warm water to soften the material before attempting removal.
- **Topical treatment**: After removal, apply a topical antibiotic ointment to the area.
- **Improve humidity**: Immediately increase brooder humidity to 50-60% or higher.
- **Monitor circulation**: Observe the toe for return of normal color and blood flow after removing the constriction.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam may be used for pain and swelling.
- **Amputation**: If the toe is already necrotic and non-viable, surgical amputation of the affected portion may be necessary. This is performed under anesthesia.

## Prevention

- **Maintain proper humidity**: Keep brooder humidity at 50-65% for most parrot species. Use a hygrometer to monitor.
- **Inspect toes daily**: Check all toes on neonatal chicks at least once daily, preferably at each feeding.
- **Keep feet clean**: Gently clean dried formula or feces from feet and toes after each feeding.
- **Use appropriate nesting substrate**: Avoid fibrous materials, loose threads, and shredding fabrics. Use smooth paper towels or non-fibrous bedding.
- **Moisturize feet**: In dry environments, light application of a safe moisturizer or coconut oil on chick feet can help prevent skin drying and cracking.
- **Proper nesting conditions**: Maintain appropriate temperature and humidity in the nest box or brooder.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is excellent when constriction is identified and treated early, before circulatory compromise becomes irreversible. Toes that are swollen but still have blood flow typically recover fully once the constriction is removed. If the toe has been constricted for an extended period and is necrotic, the affected portion will need to be amputated, but most birds adapt well to the loss of a toe tip. Prevention through proper husbandry is the most effective strategy.
