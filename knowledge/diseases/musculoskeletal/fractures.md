# Fractures in Parrots

## Overview

Fractures (broken bones) are among the most common orthopedic injuries in companion parrots. Avian bones are unique in that many are pneumatized (hollow and connected to the respiratory system), which makes them lighter for flight but also more susceptible to splintering and shattering upon impact. Fractures can range from simple hairline cracks to complex, open (compound) fractures with bone protruding through the skin. The most commonly fractured bones in parrots are the leg bones (tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus, femur) and wing bones (humerus, radius, ulna). Prompt veterinary care is critical for the best outcome.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can sustain fractures. Wing-clipped birds that fall or crash-land are at higher risk. Small birds like budgerigars and cockatiels commonly fracture leg bones, while larger birds like macaws and cockatoos may fracture both wing and leg bones. Night frights in cockatiels are a well-known cause of injury.

## Causes

- **Trauma**: Crash landings, falls from perches, caught in cage bars or doors, stepped on, or attacked by other animals (dogs, cats).
- **Night frights**: Cockatiels and other species that panic and thrash in the dark.
- **Calcium deficiency**: Nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism weakens bones, making them prone to pathological fractures.
- **Metabolic bone disease**: Insufficient calcium, vitamin D3, or improper calcium-to-phosphorus ratios.
- **Vitamin D3 deficiency**: Lack of UVB light exposure impairs calcium metabolism.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Calcium depletion in laying hens weakens bone structure.
- **Tumors or infection**: Bone tumors or osteomyelitis can weaken bone structurally.
- **Constriction injuries**: Band or ring injuries cutting off blood supply to the leg.

## Symptoms

- Visible limb deformity or abnormal angle
- Drooping wing (if wing is fractured)
- Non-weight-bearing lameness (if leg is fractured)
- Swelling at the fracture site
- Pain response when the area is touched
- Inability to perch or grip with the affected foot
- Bleeding at the site (open fractures)
- Crepitus (grinding sensation when the fracture site is palpated)
- Lethargy and decreased activity
- Reluctance to move

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Careful palpation to identify the fracture location and type. Must be performed gently, as avian bones fragment easily.
- **Radiographs (X-rays)**: Essential for confirming the diagnosis, determining fracture type (simple, comminuted, open), and planning treatment.
- **Blood work**: Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D3 levels to assess for metabolic bone disease. Complete blood count to evaluate for infection.
- **Assessment of bone quality**: Radiographic evaluation of overall bone density.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the fracture location, type, and the bird's overall health:

- **Stabilization**: The bird should be placed in a quiet, warm, padded environment to prevent further injury.
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam or butorphanol for analgesia.
- **External fixation (splinting)**: Appropriate for many simple fractures, especially in smaller birds. Materials include figure-of-eight wraps for wing fractures, ball bandages for foot fractures, and various splinting materials for leg fractures.
- **Internal fixation (surgery)**: Intramedullary pins, external skeletal fixators (ESF), or cerclage wire for complex or displaced fractures. ESF is considered the gold standard for many avian fractures.
- **Amputation**: May be considered for severely comminuted fractures or chronic non-healing fractures where limb salvage is not possible. Most parrots adapt well to amputation.
- **Nutritional support**: Calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation if deficiency is identified.
- **Antibiotics**: For open fractures or when surgical fixation is performed.
- **Rest and restricted activity**: Essential during the healing period, typically 2-6 weeks depending on the fracture.

## Prevention

- Provide a safe, bird-proofed environment during out-of-cage time.
- Use night lights for species prone to night frights (especially cockatiels).
- Ensure properly sized cage bars to prevent entrapment.
- Supervise interactions between birds and other pets.
- Feed a balanced diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D3.
- Provide full-spectrum UVB lighting.
- Train flight skills rather than clipping wings, or clip properly to allow controlled descent.
- Address chronic egg laying to prevent calcium depletion.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the fracture location, type, and treatment. Simple fractures of the tibiotarsus or tarsometatarsus have a good prognosis with appropriate stabilization. Wing fractures have a fair to good prognosis for healing, though return to full flight may be compromised depending on the bone involved. Open or comminuted fractures carry a more guarded prognosis. Fractures secondary to metabolic bone disease have a guarded prognosis until the underlying nutritional deficit is corrected. Most parrots heal well with proper veterinary care and rest.
