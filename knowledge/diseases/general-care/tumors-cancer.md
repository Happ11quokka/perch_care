# Tumors and Cancer (Neoplasia) in Parrots

## Overview

Neoplasia, the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells, can affect parrots in the form of both benign and malignant tumors. Tumors may arise in virtually any tissue or organ, including the skin, subcutaneous tissue, internal organs, reproductive tract, and bones. Lipomas (benign fatty tumors) are the most common neoplasms in pet parrots, while malignant tumors such as fibrosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and lymphomas also occur. Early detection improves treatment outcomes, as many tumors can be surgically removed when identified before they become too large or invasive.

## Affected Species

Budgerigars are the most commonly affected parrot species and have an exceptionally high incidence of neoplasia, with tumors of the kidney, gonad, and skin being particularly common. Cockatiels, Amazon Parrots, and macaws also develop tumors with notable frequency. Lipomas are especially common in Amazon Parrots, Rose-breasted Cockatoos (Galahs), and budgerigars on high-fat, seed-based diets. African Grey Parrots may develop lipomas and internal tumors. Older birds are at increased risk, though tumors can occur at any age.

## Causes

- **Genetic predisposition**: Budgerigars have a strong genetic tendency toward tumor development
- **High-fat diets**: Chronic seed-based diets contribute to lipoma formation
- **Obesity**: Excess body fat associated with higher lipoma incidence
- **Hormonal influences**: Reproductive hormones may contribute to gonadal and reproductive tract tumors
- **Viral infections**: Suspected viral involvement in some tumor types (retroviruses, papillomaviruses)
- **Chronic irritation**: Repeated tissue injury or inflammation may predispose to neoplasia
- **Environmental carcinogens**: Secondhand smoke, chemical exposure
- **Age**: Increased incidence in older birds

## Symptoms

- Visible mass or swelling under the skin (lipomas, fibrosarcomas)
- Progressive enlargement of a lump over weeks to months
- Lameness or leg paralysis (internal tumors pressing on nerves, particularly renal tumors in budgerigars)
- Abdominal distension (internal organ tumors or fluid accumulation)
- Weight loss despite normal or decreased appetite
- Lethargy and reduced activity
- Changes in droppings (color, consistency, or volume)
- Respiratory difficulty if tumor compresses airways
- Bleeding from tumor surface
- Feather loss or discoloration over tumor site
- Unilateral (one-sided) testicular swelling in males or cere color change in budgerigars (gonadal tumors)

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation of external masses and assessment of body condition
- **Fine-needle aspirate (FNA)**: Sampling cells from the mass for cytological examination to differentiate benign from malignant tumors
- **Radiographs**: Identify internal masses, organ enlargement, and metastatic disease in lungs or air sacs
- **Ultrasound**: Evaluate internal organ tumors, guide aspirate sampling, and assess mass characteristics
- **Biopsy**: Surgical tissue sampling for definitive histopathological diagnosis
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count and chemistry panel to assess organ function and overall health
- **CT scan**: Advanced imaging for surgical planning and staging when available
- **Endoscopy**: Visualization of internal masses and guided biopsy

## Treatment

- **Surgical excision**: The primary treatment for accessible tumors; complete removal with clean margins offers the best chance of cure for benign tumors and some malignant tumors
- **Lipoma management**: Surgical removal for large or functionally impairing lipomas; dietary modification (low-fat pelleted diet) to slow growth
- **Cryotherapy**: Freezing small, superficial tumors
- **Chemotherapy**: Limited use in avian medicine but available for certain tumor types (lymphoma) at specialty practices
- **Radiation therapy**: Available at some veterinary teaching hospitals for localized malignancies
- **Palliative care**: Pain management, nutritional support, and quality-of-life measures for inoperable or metastatic tumors
- **Dietary management**: Transition to low-fat, balanced diet essential for lipoma patients
- **Weight management**: Exercise and dietary modifications for obese birds with lipomas

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, low-fat diet based on formulated pellets rather than seed-only diets
- Maintain a healthy body weight through diet and exercise
- Provide regular veterinary wellness examinations for early tumor detection
- Minimize exposure to environmental carcinogens (smoke, chemical fumes)
- Monitor for lumps, bumps, and changes in body condition during routine handling
- Address hormonal imbalances through environmental and behavioral management

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies significantly by tumor type, location, and stage. Lipomas are benign and rarely life-threatening; surgical removal is usually curative, and dietary management can slow recurrence. Fibrosarcomas and other malignant soft tissue tumors may recur after surgery if margins are incomplete. Internal organ tumors (kidney, liver) often carry a guarded to poor prognosis due to late detection and surgical inaccessibility. Budgerigar renal tumors are common but rarely treatable and usually carry a poor prognosis. Lymphoma may respond temporarily to chemotherapy. Overall, early detection and complete surgical removal offer the best outcomes for most tumor types.
