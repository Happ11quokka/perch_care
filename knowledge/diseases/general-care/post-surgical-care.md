# Post-Surgical Care for Parrots

## Overview

Post-surgical care is a critical component of successful surgical outcomes in parrots. The recovery period following surgery requires careful management of pain, wound healing, nutrition, temperature regulation, and activity restriction. Birds present unique post-operative challenges compared to mammals: they have high metabolic rates requiring rapid nutritional recovery, limited body fat reserves, and a tendency to hide signs of pain and illness. Additionally, parrots may attempt to chew sutures, bandages, and surgical sites, necessitating protective measures. Close adherence to veterinary post-operative instructions is essential for optimal healing.

## Affected Species

Post-surgical care principles apply to all parrot species that undergo surgery. Common surgical procedures in parrots include tumor removal (lipomas, fibrosarcomas), crop surgery (foreign body removal, crop burn repair), fracture repair, reproductive surgery (egg-related surgeries, salpingohysterectomy), abscess drainage, and exploratory surgery. Species with higher anesthetic and surgical risk include very small birds (budgerigars, parrotlets) and very large birds (large macaws, cockatoos) due to extremes in body size.

## Causes

Post-surgical care needs arise from any surgical procedure, including:

- **Soft tissue surgery**: Tumor excision, wound repair, crop surgery, cloacal prolapse repair
- **Orthopedic surgery**: Fracture repair with pins, plates, or external fixation
- **Reproductive surgery**: Egg removal, oviduct surgery, salpingohysterectomy
- **Ophthalmic surgery**: Eye procedures, eyelid surgery
- **Endoscopic procedures**: Diagnostic or surgical endoscopy
- **Emergency surgery**: Foreign body removal, internal hemorrhage control

## Symptoms

Post-operative signs that are **normal and expected:**
- Mild lethargy for 12-24 hours following anesthesia
- Decreased appetite on the day of surgery
- Mild swelling around the surgical site
- Drowsiness and increased sleeping during the first day

**Signs requiring immediate veterinary attention:**
- Excessive bleeding from the surgical site
- Opening of the incision (dehiscence)
- Severe swelling, redness, or discharge from the wound
- Foul odor from the surgical site
- Persistent refusal to eat beyond 24 hours
- Extreme lethargy or unresponsiveness beyond the first day
- Labored breathing or respiratory distress
- Chewing or removal of sutures or bandages
- Vomiting or regurgitation
- Significant changes in droppings (bloody, absent, or severely abnormal)

## Diagnosis

Post-surgical monitoring involves regular assessment of wound healing, pain levels, appetite, droppings, and overall behavior. Follow-up veterinary examinations are typically scheduled at intervals determined by the surgeon, often 3-7 days post-surgery and then as needed. Radiographs may be taken for orthopedic procedures to assess fracture healing. Blood work may be repeated to monitor recovery and organ function. Wound assessment evaluates healing progress, infection signs, and suture integrity.

## Treatment

**Pain management:**
- Meloxicam (NSAID) is the most commonly used analgesic in avian medicine, administered orally once daily
- Butorphanol or tramadol for additional pain control as prescribed
- Pain medication should be continued for the prescribed duration; do not discontinue early even if the bird appears comfortable
- Never administer human pain medications (ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin) to birds

**Wound care:**
- Keep the surgical site clean and dry
- Monitor for signs of infection (redness, swelling, discharge, odor)
- Prevent the bird from chewing sutures; an Elizabethan collar (E-collar) may be needed
- Do not apply topical ointments unless directed by the veterinarian
- Follow the veterinarian's specific wound care instructions

**Nutrition:**
- Offer favorite foods to encourage eating as soon as the bird is alert after anesthesia
- Provide easily accessible food and water at perch height
- Assist feeding (gavage or syringe feeding) if the bird does not eat within 12-24 hours, as directed by the veterinarian
- Warm, soft foods may be more appealing initially

**Environment:**
- Keep the bird in a warm, quiet, dimly lit recovery space (28-30 degrees Celsius / 82-86 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Use a small recovery cage or hospital cage to restrict movement
- Remove perches or provide only low perches to prevent falls
- Line the cage floor with soft, clean towels (avoid loose substrates that can contaminate wounds)
- Minimize handling and stress during recovery
- Keep away from other pets and excessive noise

**Activity restriction:**
- Limit climbing, flying, and excessive movement as directed by the surgeon
- Duration of restricted activity depends on the procedure (typically 1-4 weeks)
- Gradual return to normal activity as healing progresses

## Prevention

While surgery itself cannot always be prevented, post-surgical complications can be minimized by:

- Choosing an experienced avian veterinarian for surgical procedures
- Following all pre-operative instructions (fasting protocols, medication adjustments)
- Preparing the recovery environment before surgery
- Having all prescribed medications ready
- Strictly following post-operative care instructions
- Attending all follow-up appointments
- Monitoring the bird closely during the recovery period

## Prognosis

Prognosis following surgery depends on the procedure performed, the bird's overall health, and the quality of post-operative care. Most routine surgeries (lipoma removal, simple fracture repair) carry a good prognosis with appropriate recovery management. Pain management significantly improves recovery outcomes and should not be neglected. Infection is the most common post-surgical complication but is largely preventable with proper wound care and antibiotics when indicated. Birds that eat and remain active within 24 hours of surgery generally have excellent recovery outcomes.
