# Quarantine Protocols for New Parrots

## Overview

Quarantine is the practice of isolating a newly acquired bird from existing birds for a defined period to prevent the introduction of infectious diseases into an established flock. Many avian diseases have incubation periods during which an infected bird appears healthy but is shedding pathogens. A proper quarantine period of 30-45 days minimum allows time for latent infections to manifest and provides an opportunity for diagnostic testing. Quarantine is one of the most important disease prevention measures available to bird owners and breeders and should be practiced for every new bird, regardless of the source.

## Affected Species

Quarantine protocols apply to all parrot species without exception. Birds acquired from any source, including breeders, pet stores, rescue organizations, private sellers, bird fairs, and even birds returned from boarding, should be quarantined. Particularly high-risk acquisitions include wild-caught birds, birds from large multi-bird facilities, birds with unknown medical histories, and birds from bird fairs or shows where they may have been exposed to numerous other birds.

## Causes

The need for quarantine arises from the risk of infectious disease transmission:

- **Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus with variable incubation, highly contagious
- **Polyomavirus**: Can be carried asymptomatically, deadly to young birds
- **Chlamydiosis (Psittacosis)**: Zoonotic bacterial disease with variable shedding patterns; may be latent
- **Avian Bornavirus (PDD)**: Difficult to diagnose, variable incubation period
- **Psittacid Herpesvirus (Pacheco Disease)**: Can be carried latently and activated by stress, causing fatal outbreaks
- **Mycobacteriosis (Avian Tuberculosis)**: Chronic bacterial infection difficult to detect
- **Parasites**: Internal parasites (roundworms, coccidia) and external parasites (mites, lice)
- **Bacterial and fungal infections**: Various pathogens that may be subclinical

## Symptoms

During quarantine, monitor carefully for any signs of illness:

- Changes in droppings (color, consistency, volume, odor)
- Decreased appetite or changes in eating habits
- Lethargy, fluffed feathers, or sleeping more than usual
- Respiratory signs: sneezing, nasal discharge, tail bobbing, labored breathing
- Eye discharge or swelling
- Feather abnormalities: loss, dystrophic growth, stress bars
- Weight loss (weigh regularly with a gram scale)
- Vomiting or regurgitation
- Changes in vocalization
- Limping or balance problems
- Any behavioral changes

## Diagnosis

Diagnostic testing during quarantine should include:

- **Complete physical examination** by an avian veterinarian within the first few days of acquisition
- **Complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry panel**: Baseline health assessment
- **Chlamydia psittaci testing**: PCR and/or antigen testing from choanal/cloacal swabs; combined antigen and antibody testing increases sensitivity
- **PBFD testing**: PCR blood test for circovirus DNA
- **Polyomavirus testing**: PCR testing from blood or cloacal swab
- **Fecal examination**: Direct smear and flotation for parasites, Gram stain for bacterial assessment
- **Crop Gram stain**: Evaluate normal flora versus pathogenic organisms
- **Body weight**: Establish baseline and monitor trends
- **Additional testing**: Avian bornavirus PCR, mycobacterial testing, or other disease-specific tests as recommended by the veterinarian based on the bird's history and risk factors

## Treatment

Quarantine is primarily a preventive protocol, but treatment may be initiated during the quarantine period if disease is detected:

- **Chlamydiosis**: Treatment with doxycycline for 45 days minimum
- **Parasites**: Appropriate antiparasitic medications based on species identified
- **Bacterial infections**: Targeted antibiotics based on culture and sensitivity
- **Fungal infections**: Antifungal medications as appropriate
- **PBFD**: No cure; positive birds should not be introduced to uninfected flocks
- **Nutritional correction**: Dietary transition to balanced pellet-based diet during quarantine
- **Behavioral assessment**: Evaluate temperament and socialization needs

## Prevention

**Quarantine setup requirements:**

- **Separate room**: The quarantined bird must be in a completely separate room from existing birds, ideally with a separate ventilation system or at least a closed door
- **Separate equipment**: Dedicated food dishes, water containers, cleaning supplies, and toys that are never shared with resident birds
- **Separate handling**: Care for quarantined birds last; wash hands and change clothes before handling resident birds
- **Duration**: Minimum 30-45 days; 60-90 days is preferred for high-risk acquisitions
- **Hygiene**: Disinfect all surfaces, food and water dishes daily; use avian-safe disinfectants
- **No direct or indirect contact**: Prevent any contact between quarantined and resident birds, including airborne transmission through shared ventilation
- **Hand hygiene**: Thorough handwashing with soap and water or hand sanitizer between handling quarantined and resident birds
- **Foot hygiene**: Dedicated shoes or shoe covers for the quarantine area

## Prognosis

Quarantine protocols, when properly implemented, are highly effective at preventing disease introduction into established flocks. The vast majority of common avian infectious diseases will manifest or be detected through testing within a 30-45 day quarantine period. Birds that pass quarantine testing and observation with no signs of illness can be introduced to the resident flock with significantly reduced risk. Failure to quarantine new acquisitions remains one of the most common causes of disease outbreaks in multi-bird households and aviaries.
