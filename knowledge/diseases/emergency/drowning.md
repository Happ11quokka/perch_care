# Drowning and Near-Drowning in Parrots

## Overview

Drowning and near-drowning are preventable emergencies that occur when a parrot falls into or becomes submerged in water and is unable to escape. While many parrots enjoy bathing, they are not natural swimmers and can quickly become waterlogged, exhausted, and unable to keep their heads above water. Near-drowning refers to survival after submersion, where the bird aspirates water into the lungs and air sacs. This can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious secondary complication that may develop hours to days after the initial incident. Even brief submersion can be life-threatening.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are at risk, as none are adapted for sustained swimming. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, parrotlets, and lovebirds are at particular risk because they can drown in surprisingly small volumes of water, including drinking glasses, open toilet bowls, and cooking pots. Wing-clipped birds are at increased risk because they cannot fly out of water if they fall in. Young, elderly, or weakened birds are also at higher risk due to reduced strength and coordination.

## Causes

- **Open toilet bowls**: One of the most common drowning hazards for pet birds
- **Sinks and basins**: Filled sinks left unattended
- **Cooking pots and pans**: Open containers of water or other liquids in the kitchen
- **Bathtubs**: Unsupervised bathing in tubs or filled basins
- **Drinking glasses and cups**: Open beverages left on counters or tables
- **Aquariums and fish tanks**: Open-top tanks accessible to birds
- **Swimming pools and hot tubs**: Birds falling in outdoors
- **Deep water dishes**: Water containers too deep for the bird's size
- **Pet water bowls**: Dog or cat water bowls that are too large and deep
- **Decorative fountains**: Indoor or outdoor water features

## Symptoms

**Immediate signs after rescue:**
- Waterlogged feathers, wet and matted plumage
- Gasping, coughing, and difficulty breathing
- Weakness and inability to stand or perch
- Shivering and hypothermia
- Lethargy and unresponsiveness
- Water dripping from nares (nostrils) or mouth

**Delayed signs (aspiration pneumonia, hours to days later):**
- Respiratory distress: open-mouth breathing, tail bobbing, labored respiration
- Clicking or wheezing respiratory sounds
- Nasal discharge
- Lethargy and decreased appetite
- Fluffed feathers
- Fever or abnormal body temperature
- Progressive decline

## Diagnosis

Initial diagnosis is based on the known submersion event and clinical presentation. Physical examination focuses on respiratory status, body temperature, and level of consciousness. Auscultation may reveal crackles, wheezes, or fluid sounds in the lungs and air sacs. Radiographs are essential to evaluate the lungs and air sacs for fluid accumulation and developing pneumonia. Complete blood count may show elevated white blood cells indicating infection. Blood chemistry assesses organ function. Culture and sensitivity of tracheal samples may be performed if pneumonia develops to guide antibiotic selection.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid:**
1. Remove the bird from the water immediately
2. Hold the bird gently with its head lower than its body to allow water to drain from the airway (do not swing or shake the bird)
3. Gently clear any visible water from the nares and mouth
4. Wrap the bird in a warm, dry towel
5. Provide supplemental warmth using a heat lamp, heating pad (on low, under a towel), or warm environment (29-32 degrees Celsius / 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit)
6. Transport to an avian veterinarian immediately

**Veterinary treatment:**
- Oxygen therapy for respiratory support
- Warmth and temperature stabilization
- Antibiotics (broad-spectrum initially, then targeted based on culture) to prevent or treat aspiration pneumonia
- Antifungal medications if fungal pneumonia develops secondarily
- Fluid therapy for dehydration and circulatory support
- Anti-inflammatory medications
- Nebulization therapy to help clear airway secretions
- Monitoring with serial radiographs for pneumonia development

## Prevention

- **Always keep toilet lids closed** in homes with birds
- Never leave birds unsupervised near any body of water
- Empty sinks, bathtubs, and basins when not in use
- Cover cooking pots and pans, especially those with hot liquids
- Use shallow water dishes appropriate for the bird's size for bathing
- Cover aquariums and fish tanks with secure lids
- Do not leave open beverages accessible to birds
- Supervise all bathing activities
- Ensure wing-clipped birds are not placed near deep water sources
- Use bird-safe, shallow bath dishes designed for the species

## Prognosis

Prognosis for near-drowning depends on the duration of submersion, the amount of water aspirated, and the speed of rescue and treatment. Birds rescued quickly before significant water aspiration have a good prognosis with prompt warming and monitoring. Aspiration pneumonia, if it develops, carries a guarded prognosis but can often be managed successfully with aggressive antibiotic therapy and supportive care when caught early. Prolonged submersion leading to severe hypoxia and hypothermia carries a poor prognosis. Birds that survive the initial event must be monitored closely for 48-72 hours for delayed pneumonia development.
