# Shock in Parrots

## Overview

Shock is a life-threatening condition of circulatory collapse in which the body's tissues and organs do not receive adequate blood flow, oxygen, and nutrients. In parrots, shock can develop rapidly following trauma, severe blood loss, dehydration, infection (septic shock), toxin exposure, or extreme stress. Because birds have high metabolic rates and limited physiological reserves, they can deteriorate from mild illness to full shock within hours. Shock is a veterinary emergency requiring immediate stabilization, warmth, and professional medical intervention to prevent organ failure and death.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop shock. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets are particularly vulnerable due to their lower blood volume, higher surface area-to-volume ratio (leading to rapid heat loss), and higher metabolic demands. However, larger parrots including macaws, cockatoos, Amazon Parrots, and African Grey Parrots are equally susceptible to shock from severe trauma, hemorrhage, or sepsis. Young, elderly, and immunocompromised birds are at heightened risk.

## Causes

- **Hemorrhagic shock**: Severe blood loss from broken blood feathers, lacerations, or internal hemorrhage
- **Hypovolemic shock**: Severe dehydration from prolonged illness, diarrhea, or inability to drink
- **Traumatic shock**: Following animal attacks, falls, collisions, or crushing injuries
- **Septic shock**: Overwhelming bacterial, fungal, or viral infection
- **Toxic shock**: Severe toxin exposure (heavy metals, inhaled toxins, ingested poisons)
- **Cardiogenic shock**: Heart failure resulting in inadequate cardiac output
- **Thermal shock**: Hypothermia or severe hyperthermia
- **Anaphylactic shock**: Severe allergic reactions (rare but possible)
- **Neurogenic shock**: Severe pain, fear, or head/spinal trauma
- **Capture stress/restraint shock**: Excessive handling or restraint, particularly in stressed or wild birds

## Symptoms

Recognizing shock early is critical. Signs include:

- Fluffed feathers and ruffled appearance
- Eyes partially or fully closed, dull expression
- Cold feet, legs, and beak (peripheral vasoconstriction)
- Weakness and inability to perch (sitting on cage floor)
- Unresponsive or minimally responsive to stimuli
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Rapid and weak heartbeat
- Pale mucous membranes (inside mouth, cloaca)
- Extreme lethargy and depression
- Loss of muscle tone (limp body when handled)
- Decreased or absent vocalization
- Loss of balance and recumbency
- In late stages: loss of consciousness, agonal breathing, death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of shock is primarily clinical, based on physical examination findings and history. Assessment includes body temperature (often hypothermic), heart rate (often tachycardic but may be bradycardic in decompensated shock), respiratory rate and effort, capillary refill time, and level of consciousness. Blood work including complete blood count, blood chemistry, and blood glucose helps identify the underlying cause and assess organ function. Blood glucose may be dangerously low (hypoglycemia) or elevated (stress response). Packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein help evaluate hydration and blood loss. Radiographs or ultrasound may be needed to identify internal injuries or organ changes. Blood culture is indicated if septic shock is suspected.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid (before reaching veterinarian):**
1. **Warmth**: Place the bird in a warm, quiet, dark environment (29-32 degrees Celsius / 85-90 degrees Fahrenheit) using a heat lamp, heating pad under a towel, or warm room
2. **Minimize handling**: Reduce all stress; do not attempt to give food or water to an unresponsive bird
3. **Stop bleeding**: Apply direct pressure to any active hemorrhage
4. **Transport quietly**: Place the bird in a small, dark, padded container and transport to an avian veterinarian immediately

**Veterinary treatment:**
- **Fluid therapy**: Warmed intravenous or intraosseous fluids (crystalloids, colloids) are the cornerstone of shock treatment
- **Warmth**: Incubator or supplemental heat to correct hypothermia
- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen to improve tissue oxygenation
- **Glucose supplementation**: Dextrose in IV fluids for hypoglycemia
- **Corticosteroids**: Short-acting corticosteroids may be used in acute shock (controversial but sometimes employed)
- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics for septic shock or open wounds
- **Pain management**: Appropriate analgesics (butorphanol, meloxicam)
- **Blood transfusion**: In cases of severe hemorrhage (using a compatible donor bird)
- **Cardiac support**: Treatment of arrhythmias or cardiac failure as needed
- **Addressing the underlying cause**: Chelation for heavy metals, surgery for internal injuries, etc.

## Prevention

- Maintain a safe, bird-proofed environment to prevent trauma
- Keep cats and dogs separated from birds
- Provide constant access to fresh water to prevent dehydration
- Seek veterinary care early for any illness before it progresses to critical stages
- Handle birds gently and minimize stress during restraint
- Maintain appropriate environmental temperatures
- Remove toxic substances from the bird's environment
- Have an avian first aid kit prepared and know the location of the nearest avian emergency veterinarian

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause, severity, and speed of intervention. Early-stage (compensated) shock treated promptly with warmth, fluids, and appropriate medical care has a fair to good prognosis. Decompensated shock with severe hypothermia, unconsciousness, and multi-organ failure carries a poor to grave prognosis. Hemorrhagic shock from controlled bleeding sources (broken blood feather) responds well to treatment when addressed quickly. Septic shock requires aggressive antibiotic therapy and carries a guarded prognosis. The single most important prognostic factor is the time between onset and initiation of treatment.
