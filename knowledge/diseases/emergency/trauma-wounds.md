# Trauma and Wounds in Parrots

## Overview

Traumatic injuries and wounds are common veterinary emergencies in pet parrots. These can result from animal attacks, falls, collisions, and interactions with household hazards. The severity ranges from minor abrasions to life-threatening injuries including deep lacerations, fractures, and internal organ damage. All bite wounds from cats require immediate veterinary attention due to the high risk of fatal Pasteurella multocida infection. Prompt wound assessment, stabilization, and veterinary care are critical for favorable outcomes.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are at risk for traumatic injuries. Free-flighted birds are vulnerable to window and mirror strikes, ceiling fan injuries, and wall collisions. Wing-clipped birds may sustain injuries from falls and crash landings. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, and lovebirds are more vulnerable to attack by cats, dogs, and larger birds. Larger parrots may sustain bite wounds from other parrots during aggressive encounters or from household pets.

## Causes

- **Cat attacks**: Bites and scratches carry Pasteurella multocida and other dangerous bacteria; even minor cat-inflicted wounds can be fatal
- **Dog attacks**: Crushing injuries, lacerations, and internal trauma from dog bites
- **Other bird attacks**: Bite wounds from cage mates or other household birds, particularly beak injuries to toes and feet
- **Window and mirror strikes**: Collisions during flight causing head trauma, neck injuries, and wing fractures
- **Ceiling fan injuries**: Severe lacerations, fractures, and fatal injuries from contact with spinning fan blades
- **Falls**: From high perches, play stands, or during failed flight attempts (especially wing-clipped birds)
- **Door crushing**: Birds caught in closing doors
- **Stepped on**: Accidental trampling by owners, especially smaller species
- **Household object collisions**: Flying into walls, furniture, or decorative items

## Symptoms

- Visible wounds: lacerations, punctures, abrasions, and bleeding
- Swelling and bruising around injury sites
- Limping, wing droop, or inability to fly (possible fracture)
- Reluctance to move or perch
- Favoring one foot or shifting weight
- Bleeding from wounds, nares, or cloaca
- Lethargy and shock: fluffed feathers, closed eyes, cold feet, unresponsiveness
- Head tilt, disorientation, or seizures (head trauma)
- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) if chest wall or air sacs are compromised
- Visible bone through skin (open fracture)
- Loss of appetite

## Diagnosis

Thorough physical examination under appropriate restraint is essential. All wounds should be carefully evaluated for depth, contamination, and proximity to vital structures. Radiographs are critical for assessing fractures, air sac integrity, and internal injuries. Complete blood count evaluates blood loss, infection, and inflammatory response. Blood chemistry panel assesses organ function. Culture and sensitivity testing of wound samples guide antibiotic selection. Fluorescein staining is used to assess corneal damage in facial injuries. CT imaging may be warranted for head trauma or complex fractures.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid:**
1. Control bleeding with direct pressure using clean gauze
2. Keep the bird warm and quiet in a dark, enclosed container
3. Do not attempt to clean deep wounds or remove foreign material
4. Transport to an avian veterinarian as an emergency

**Veterinary treatment:**
- **Wound care**: Gentle irrigation with sterile saline, debridement of devitalized tissue, and appropriate closure (sutures, tissue glue, or open wound management)
- **Antibiotics**: Essential for all bite wounds, especially cat bites; broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against Pasteurella are critical (amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolones, or doxycycline)
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam, butorphanol, or tramadol for analgesia
- **Fracture management**: Splinting, bandaging, or surgical repair (pins, plates) for bone fractures
- **Fluid therapy**: IV or subcutaneous fluids for shock, dehydration, and blood loss
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: To reduce swelling and inflammation
- **Crop gavage feeding**: Nutritional support for birds unable to eat normally
- **Bandaging**: Appropriate bandaging techniques for wings (figure-8 wrap), legs, and body wounds
- **Head trauma protocol**: Anti-inflammatory medications, seizure control, and monitoring for concussion

## Prevention

- Keep cats and dogs physically separated from birds at all times
- Supervise all out-of-cage time
- Turn off ceiling fans before releasing birds from cages
- Apply window decals or UV-reflective stickers to prevent window strikes
- Secure doors when birds are out of cages
- Use door wedges or door stops to prevent accidental closures
- Be aware of the bird's location on floors before walking
- Introduce birds to each other gradually and supervise interactions
- Provide adequate cage space for multiple birds to prevent territorial aggression
- Bird-proof rooms before allowing flight

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies widely depending on the nature and severity of the injury. Minor abrasions and superficial lacerations have a good prognosis with proper wound care. Cat bite wounds carry a guarded prognosis due to the high virulence of Pasteurella, which can cause fatal septicemia within 24-72 hours even from apparently minor punctures; aggressive antibiotic therapy must be initiated immediately. Simple fractures managed with appropriate stabilization generally heal well. Complex fractures, open fractures, and spinal injuries carry a more guarded prognosis. Head trauma outcomes depend on the severity of brain injury. Prompt veterinary intervention is the single most important factor in determining outcome.
