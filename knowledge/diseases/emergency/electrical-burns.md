# Electrical Burns in Parrots

## Overview

Electrical burns occur when a parrot chews through or contacts an energized electrical cord, wire, or outlet, resulting in electrical current passing through the bird's body. Parrots are particularly at risk because of their instinctive need to chew and explore with their beaks, which makes electrical cords an attractive target during out-of-cage time. Electrical injuries can range from mild oral burns to severe electrocution resulting in cardiac arrest and death. Even seemingly minor electrical burns warrant veterinary evaluation due to the risk of internal injuries not immediately apparent on external examination.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible, though species with stronger chewing instincts and more powerful beaks may be at slightly higher risk. Macaws, cockatoos, and Amazon Parrots can easily sever electrical cords with their powerful beaks. However, smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, conures, and lovebirds are equally at risk because even lower-voltage household current can be fatal to a small bird. Young, curious birds and those with unsupervised out-of-cage time are most frequently affected.

## Causes

- **Chewing electrical cords**: Lamp cords, phone chargers, computer cables, appliance cords
- **Contact with exposed wiring**: Damaged or frayed cords with exposed copper wire
- **Chewing on power strips**: Multi-outlet power strips accessible to birds
- **Light fixture contact**: Birds landing on or chewing lamp fixtures
- **Holiday lights and decorations**: String lights and decorative wiring
- **Outlet contact**: Birds inserting beaks or tongues into uncovered electrical outlets
- **Extension cords**: Temporary wiring draped across floors or furniture within reach

## Symptoms

**Oral burns:**
- Burns or charring on the beak, tongue, and oral mucosa
- Swelling of the oral tissues and tongue
- Difficulty eating and reluctance to eat
- Excessive salivation or drooling
- Pain when opening the mouth
- Discoloration or blackening of beak tissue

**Systemic signs (from significant electrical exposure):**
- Sudden collapse or loss of consciousness
- Cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest
- Respiratory distress (pulmonary edema from electrical injury)
- Tremors, seizures, or neurological abnormalities
- Burns along the path of current through the body (entry and exit wounds)
- Muscle rigidity or paralysis
- Shock: fluffed feathers, cold feet, unresponsiveness

**Delayed signs (hours to days later):**
- Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) developing over 24-48 hours
- Secondary infection of burn wounds
- Tissue necrosis extending beyond the initial visible burn area
- Difficulty breathing from delayed pulmonary complications

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is typically based on witnessed or suspected electrical cord contact combined with characteristic oral burns. Physical examination reveals thermal burns on the beak, oral tissues, or skin. Cardiac auscultation and electrocardiography (ECG) assess for arrhythmias. Thoracic radiographs evaluate for pulmonary edema, which may not develop for 24-48 hours after the incident. Complete blood count and blood chemistry panel assess overall organ function and inflammatory response. Serial monitoring is important because pulmonary edema and tissue necrosis can progress over days.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid:**
1. Ensure the electrical source is disconnected or the bird is safely separated from the current (do not touch the bird while it is in contact with live current)
2. Check for breathing and heartbeat
3. Keep the bird warm, calm, and quiet
4. Transport to an avian veterinarian immediately

**Veterinary treatment:**
- **Burn wound care**: Gentle cleaning and debridement of oral burns, topical antimicrobial agents
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam or other appropriate analgesics
- **Antibiotics**: Systemic antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary infection of burn wounds
- **Fluid therapy**: IV or subcutaneous fluids for hydration and circulatory support
- **Cardiac monitoring**: ECG and treatment of arrhythmias if present
- **Pulmonary edema management**: Diuretics (furosemide) and oxygen therapy if edema develops
- **Nutritional support**: Soft foods or gavage feeding if oral burns prevent normal eating
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: To reduce tissue swelling
- **Serial monitoring**: Repeated radiographs and examinations over 48-72 hours to check for delayed complications

## Prevention

- **Bird-proof all electrical cords**: Use cord covers, cable management systems, or flexible conduit to encase all accessible cords
- **Unplug appliances when not in use**: Remove the temptation by eliminating energized cords
- **Use outlet covers**: Child-proof outlet covers on all unused electrical outlets
- **Supervise out-of-cage time**: Never leave a bird unsupervised in a room with accessible electrical cords
- **Designate bird-safe rooms**: Create spaces where all electrical hazards have been eliminated
- **Apply bitter-taste deterrents**: Products like bitter apple spray on cord exteriors (though this is not a reliable sole prevention method)
- **Route cords out of reach**: Run cables behind furniture, through walls, or along ceilings
- **Remove holiday decorations**: Take down string lights and electrical decorations when birds are present

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity of the electrical injury. Minor oral burns that do not involve deep tissue have a good prognosis with appropriate wound care, pain management, and time. The beak and oral mucosa have good regenerative capacity. More severe electrical injuries with cardiac involvement or pulmonary edema carry a guarded to poor prognosis. Birds that survive the initial event but develop delayed pulmonary edema require intensive care. Complete electrocution is immediately fatal. Follow-up monitoring for 48-72 hours after the incident is essential, as delayed complications can alter the prognosis.
