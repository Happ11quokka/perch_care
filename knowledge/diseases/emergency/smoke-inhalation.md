# Smoke Inhalation in Parrots

## Overview

Smoke inhalation is an acute respiratory emergency in parrots caused by breathing in smoke, soot particles, and toxic gases produced by combustion. Birds have an exceptionally efficient respiratory system with air sacs and cross-current gas exchange, which unfortunately makes them dramatically more susceptible to airborne toxins than mammals. Smoke contains a complex mixture of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, particulate matter, and other toxic gases that cause direct damage to the respiratory tract, impair oxygen delivery, and can lead to rapid death. Even low-level smoke exposure that might be tolerable for humans can be fatal to parrots.

## Affected Species

All bird species are extremely sensitive to smoke inhalation. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, canaries, and finches may succumb more rapidly due to their higher metabolic rate and smaller lung capacity. Larger parrots including macaws, cockatoos, Amazon Parrots, and African Grey Parrots are also severely affected. Historically, canaries were used as sentinel animals in coal mines because of their acute sensitivity to toxic gases, and this sensitivity applies to all pet birds.

## Causes

- **House fires**: The most dangerous source of smoke exposure
- **Kitchen fires and cooking accidents**: Burning food, grease fires, oven fires
- **PTFE/Teflon fumes**: Overheated non-stick cookware releasing toxic polytetrafluoroethylene gas
- **Scented candles and incense**: Burning candles, incense sticks, and essential oil diffusers
- **Tobacco and marijuana smoke**: Secondhand smoke from cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or marijuana
- **Wood-burning fireplaces and stoves**: Especially in poorly ventilated rooms
- **Outdoor burning**: Brush fires, barbecue smoke, wildfire smoke entering the home
- **Space heater malfunctions**: Burning dust, overheating components
- **Electrical fires**: Smoldering wires, overloaded circuits

## Symptoms

Onset can be extremely rapid, especially with concentrated smoke exposure:

- Respiratory distress: open-mouth breathing, gasping, tail bobbing
- Increased respiratory rate and effort
- Wheezing, clicking, or crackling respiratory sounds
- Nasal and ocular discharge (soot-stained or clear)
- Soot around nares (nostrils) and mouth
- Coughing or sneezing
- Disorientation and ataxia
- Lethargy and weakness
- Loss of voice or changes in vocalization
- Collapse and loss of consciousness
- Seizures
- Sudden death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on known smoke exposure combined with respiratory signs. Physical examination focuses on respiratory rate and quality, auscultation of lungs and air sacs, and assessment of consciousness and neurological status. Radiographs reveal pulmonary infiltrates, air sac opacification, and signs of pulmonary edema. Complete blood count may show an inflammatory response. Blood gas analysis, when available, reveals hypoxemia and potential carbon monoxide elevation. Carboxyhemoglobin levels can confirm carbon monoxide poisoning but are not always available for avian patients. Tracheal wash with cytology and culture helps guide treatment if secondary pneumonia develops.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid:**
1. Remove the bird from the smoke-filled environment to fresh, clean air immediately
2. Keep the bird warm and quiet, wrapped in a towel
3. Do not give water or food until the bird is stable and alert
4. Transport to an avian veterinarian as an emergency

**Veterinary treatment:**
- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen in an oxygen cage or with a face mask is the most critical intervention
- **Nebulization**: Saline nebulization to hydrate damaged airway tissue and assist mucus clearance
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: Corticosteroids or NSAIDs to reduce airway inflammation and edema
- **Bronchodilators**: Terbutaline or aminophylline to open constricted airways
- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial pneumonia
- **Antifungal medications**: Prophylactic antifungals, as compromised airways are susceptible to aspergillosis
- **Fluid therapy**: IV or subcutaneous fluids for hydration and circulatory support
- **Pain management**: Analgesics for airway pain and discomfort
- **Monitoring**: Serial radiographs and clinical assessments over several days

## Prevention

- Install smoke detectors throughout the home, especially near bird areas
- Keep birds away from kitchens and cooking areas
- Never burn candles, incense, or essential oils in rooms with birds
- Do not smoke tobacco or marijuana in the home or near birds
- Ensure fireplaces and wood stoves are properly vented with sealed doors
- Remove all non-stick (PTFE-coated) cookware from the home
- Have a fire evacuation plan that includes bird transport carriers
- Keep transport carriers accessible for rapid evacuation
- Maintain carbon monoxide detectors near bird living areas
- Close windows during nearby brush or wildfire events and use air purifiers

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the type of smoke, concentration, duration of exposure, and speed of treatment. Brief exposure to mild smoke with prompt removal and supportive care carries a fair to good prognosis. PTFE fume exposure carries a grave prognosis, with death often occurring before treatment can begin. House fire smoke exposure has a guarded prognosis due to the combination of particulates, heat, and multiple toxic gases. Even birds that initially survive may develop secondary pneumonia or chronic respiratory damage over the following days to weeks. Long-term sequelae can include chronic respiratory disease, air sacculitis, and increased susceptibility to aspergillosis.
