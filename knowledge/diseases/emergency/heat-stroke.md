# Heat Stroke (Hyperthermia) in Parrots

## Overview

Heat stroke, or hyperthermia, occurs when a parrot's body temperature rises dangerously above normal levels (typically above 42-43 degrees Celsius / 108-109 degrees Fahrenheit) and the bird can no longer regulate its core temperature through normal thermoregulatory mechanisms. Unlike mammals, birds cannot sweat and rely on panting (gular flutter), vasodilation of blood vessels in unfeathered areas, and behavioral modifications to dissipate heat. Heat stroke is a true veterinary emergency that can cause multi-organ failure and death within minutes to hours if not addressed immediately.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to heat stroke. Species from temperate climates such as budgerigars and cockatiels may be more vulnerable than tropical species, though all birds have limits. Obese birds, elderly birds, and those with pre-existing respiratory or cardiovascular disease are at increased risk. Dark-feathered species may absorb more radiant heat. Young, unfeathered chicks are also extremely vulnerable to overheating.

## Causes

- **Direct sunlight exposure**: Cage placed in direct sun without access to shade
- **Enclosed vehicles**: Birds left in parked cars, even briefly
- **Poor ventilation**: Inadequate airflow in the bird's environment
- **High ambient temperature and humidity**: Environmental heat combined with humidity preventing evaporative cooling
- **Travel without climate control**: Transport in non-air-conditioned vehicles or carriers without ventilation
- **Overheating appliances**: Bird cage too close to heaters, radiators, or heat lamps
- **Excessive physical activity**: Prolonged flight or agitation in hot conditions
- **Lack of drinking water**: Inability to regulate temperature through evaporation from the respiratory tract

## Symptoms

- Open-mouth breathing and panting (gular flutter)
- Wings held away from the body (drooped or spread for heat dissipation)
- Rapid respiratory rate
- Lethargy and weakness
- Unsteadiness and ataxia
- Hot feet and beak to the touch
- Disorientation and confusion
- Collapse and inability to perch
- Seizures in severe cases
- Loss of consciousness
- Death if not treated promptly

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs combined with a history of heat exposure. Cloacal temperature measurement confirms hyperthermia. Physical examination reveals increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, and peripheral vasodilation. Blood work may show dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated liver and kidney enzymes indicating organ stress. In severe cases, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) markers may be present.

## Treatment

**Immediate first aid (before veterinary care):**
- Move the bird to a cool, shaded area immediately
- Mist the bird lightly with room-temperature water (not ice cold)
- Place the bird near a fan for airflow
- Offer cool (not cold) fresh water if the bird is conscious and able to drink
- Do NOT immerse the bird in cold water or apply ice, as this causes peripheral vasoconstriction and traps core heat
- Cool gradually; rapid cooling can cause shock

**Veterinary treatment:**
- Intravenous or subcutaneous fluid therapy to correct dehydration and support circulation
- Continued controlled cooling with monitoring of body temperature
- Oxygen therapy if respiratory compromise is present
- Anti-inflammatory medications
- Treatment of secondary complications (seizures, organ failure, DIC)
- Blood work monitoring for organ damage

## Prevention

- Never place a bird's cage in direct sunlight without access to shade
- Never leave a bird in a parked car, even for a few minutes
- Ensure adequate ventilation in the bird's environment at all times
- Provide fresh water at all times, especially in warm weather
- Use air conditioning or fans during hot weather
- Monitor indoor temperatures; maintain below 30 degrees Celsius (85 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Mist birds with water during heat waves for cooling
- Avoid transporting birds during the hottest parts of the day
- Provide bathing opportunities for natural cooling behavior

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity and duration of hyperthermia, as well as the speed of cooling and veterinary intervention. Mild heat stress caught early and treated promptly has a good prognosis. Moderate heat stroke with prompt treatment carries a fair to guarded prognosis. Severe hyperthermia with seizures, organ failure, or DIC carries a poor prognosis. Multi-organ failure following prolonged hyperthermia is frequently fatal despite aggressive treatment. Recovery may take several days, and secondary organ damage may not become apparent for 24-48 hours.
