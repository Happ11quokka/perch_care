# Night Frights in Parrots

## Overview

Night frights are sudden episodes of panic and thrashing that occur during darkness, when a bird becomes startled and disoriented in its cage. During a night fright, the bird may violently flap its wings, crash into cage bars, perches, and toys, and fall to the cage floor. These episodes can result in serious injuries including broken blood feathers, wing and leg fractures, lacerations, concussions, and significant blood loss. While night frights themselves are not a disease, the injuries sustained can constitute a veterinary emergency.

## Affected Species

Cockatiels are the most commonly affected species and are notorious for night fright episodes. Budgerigars, lovebirds, and other smaller parrots are also frequently prone to night frights. Larger parrots such as Amazon Parrots, African Grey Parrots, macaws, and cockatoos can experience night frights but less commonly. Newly acquired birds, birds in unfamiliar environments, and those with a nervous temperament are at increased risk. Wild-caught birds may be more susceptible than captive-bred individuals.

## Causes

- **Sudden noises**: Loud sounds at night such as thunder, fireworks, passing vehicles, or household noises
- **Light flashes**: Car headlights through windows, lightning, flashing lights from electronics
- **Shadows and movement**: Shadows from outside (tree branches, passing cars, animals) projected onto walls or cage covers
- **Vibrations**: Earthquakes, heavy vehicles passing, or household vibrations
- **Predator presence**: Actual or perceived presence of nocturnal predators (cats, rodents, raccoons visible through windows)
- **Insects**: Moths, flies, or other insects disturbing the bird at night
- **Complete darkness**: Some birds become disoriented in total darkness and panic when startled
- **Nightmares**: While unproven, some avian behaviorists theorize birds may experience night terrors during REM sleep

## Symptoms

During an episode:
- Violent wing flapping and thrashing within the cage
- Loud vocalizations (screaming, alarm calls)
- Crashing into cage bars, perches, toys, and food dishes
- Falling to the cage floor
- Continued panic and disorientation for minutes after the initial startle

After an episode (injuries to assess):
- Broken blood feathers with active bleeding
- Damaged or bent flight and tail feathers
- Lacerations and abrasions on wings, feet, face, and cere
- Bruising
- Limping or unwillingness to perch (possible fracture)
- Dazed appearance or head tilt (possible concussion)
- Blood on cage bars, perches, or cage floor

## Diagnosis

Night frights are diagnosed based on the characteristic presentation: finding the bird on the cage floor in the morning with evidence of thrashing (scattered feathers, blood, displaced perches and toys) or witnessing the episode directly. Assessment focuses on identifying any injuries sustained. Physical examination should check for blood feathers, fractures, lacerations, head injuries, and internal trauma. Radiographs may be needed if fractures are suspected. If night frights are recurring, an investigation into environmental triggers is warranted.

## Treatment

**Immediate response during an episode:**
- Speak to the bird calmly and quietly from outside the cage
- Turn on a dim light gradually (avoid sudden bright lights)
- Do not reach into the cage immediately, as the panicking bird may bite or injure itself further
- Allow the bird to calm down before handling

**Injury treatment:**
- For bleeding blood feathers: apply direct pressure with gauze; if bleeding does not stop, the feather shaft may need to be pulled with hemostats
- Apply styptic powder to minor bleeding wounds (not on open wounds or eyes)
- Clean lacerations with dilute chlorhexidine or saline
- Seek veterinary care for significant bleeding, suspected fractures, head injuries, or lacerations requiring sutures
- Monitor for signs of concussion over the next 24-48 hours

## Prevention

- **Night light**: Provide a small, dim night light near (but not directly on) the cage to help the bird orient itself if startled
- **Cage placement**: Position the cage against a wall (not in the middle of a room) so the bird has a sense of security from behind
- **Window coverings**: Use curtains or blinds to block external light flashes and shadows
- **Cage cover**: Use a breathable cage cover that blocks visual stimuli but allows airflow; leave one side partially uncovered for orientation
- **Reduce cage hazards**: Remove sharp toys and excessive accessories that could cause injury during thrashing
- **Perch placement**: Secure perches firmly; use perches that are appropriate diameter for the species
- **Environmental consistency**: Minimize nighttime disruptions; keep the sleep area quiet
- **White noise**: A gentle white noise machine can mask sudden external sounds
- **Predator exclusion**: Ensure cats and other animals cannot access the bird's sleeping area

## Prognosis

Prognosis for individual night fright episodes depends on the injuries sustained. Most episodes result in minor feather damage and small abrasions that heal quickly with a good prognosis. Broken blood feathers that are promptly treated also carry a good prognosis. Fractures, concussions, and severe lacerations require veterinary intervention but can heal well with appropriate care. Rarely, massive hemorrhage from multiple broken blood feathers or severe head trauma can be fatal. Implementing preventive measures significantly reduces the frequency and severity of future episodes.
