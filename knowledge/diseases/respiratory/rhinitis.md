# Rhinitis (Nasal Inflammation)

## Overview

Rhinitis in parrots refers to inflammation of the nasal passages, resulting in sneezing, nasal discharge, and upper respiratory discomfort. It is one of the most common respiratory presentations in companion birds and can range from mild irritation to a sign of serious systemic disease. Because rhinitis has many possible underlying causes, a thorough diagnostic workup is essential to determine proper treatment.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop rhinitis. Cockatiels, budgerigars, and African grey parrots are frequently affected. Dusty species like cockatiels may present more often due to their natural powder-down production.

## Causes

- **Bacterial infections**: Gram-negative bacteria (*E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*) and *Mycoplasma* species are common causes.
- **Chlamydiosis**: *Chlamydia psittaci* is an important differential that must be ruled out, as it is zoonotic (transmissible to humans).
- **Fungal infections**: *Aspergillus* species can cause upper respiratory disease.
- **Viral infections**: Avian influenza, paramyxovirus, and herpesvirus can cause nasal inflammation.
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Leads to squamous metaplasia of nasal mucosa, predisposing to infection.
- **Environmental irritants**: Smoke, aerosols, scented candles, cleaning chemicals, and excessive dust.
- **Foreign bodies**: Seed husks or other debris lodged in the nares.

## Symptoms

- Sneezing (frequent or persistent)
- Nasal discharge (clear, mucoid, or purulent)
- Blocked or occluded nares
- Head shaking
- Rubbing the beak on perches or cage bars
- Periorbital swelling if sinuses are also involved
- Decreased vocalization or voice changes
- Lethargy and appetite loss in severe cases

## Diagnosis

- Physical examination of the nares and choana
- Nasal swab for bacterial culture and sensitivity
- **Chlamydia PCR testing** is critical to rule out chlamydiosis
- Cytology of nasal discharge
- Radiographs to rule out sinus involvement
- Complete blood count to assess infection severity
- Vitamin A level assessment based on dietary history

## Treatment

- **Antibiotics**: Based on culture and sensitivity results. Doxycycline is used if chlamydiosis is confirmed.
- **Nasal flush**: Sterile saline flushes to clear discharge and debris from nares.
- **Antifungals**: Itraconazole or voriconazole if fungal infection is identified.
- **Vitamin A supplementation**: Injectable vitamin A or dietary correction if deficiency is suspected.
- **Environmental improvements**: Remove irritants, improve ventilation, and maintain appropriate humidity.
- **Nebulization therapy**: Saline or medicated nebulization can help moisten airways and deliver medication directly.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced diet rich in vitamin A precursors (beta-carotene from vegetables).
- Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke, Teflon fumes, aerosols, and scented products.
- Maintain good air quality with appropriate ventilation and air filtration.
- Quarantine and test new birds before introducing them to the flock.
- Regular veterinary check-ups with choanal examination.

## Prognosis

Prognosis for rhinitis is generally good when the underlying cause is identified and treated promptly. Chronic rhinitis from vitamin A deficiency responds well to dietary correction. Cases caused by chlamydiosis require prolonged antibiotic treatment but carry a favorable prognosis with compliance.
