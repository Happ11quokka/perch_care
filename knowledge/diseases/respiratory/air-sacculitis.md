# Air Sacculitis

## Overview

Air sacculitis is the inflammation or infection of one or more of the avian air sacs. Birds possess a unique respiratory system with typically nine air sacs that function as bellows to move air through the rigid lungs. Unlike mammalian lungs, avian air sacs have a very thin membrane with minimal blood supply, making infections difficult to treat because systemic medications reach the air sacs in low concentrations. Air sacculitis is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt veterinary intervention.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible. African grey parrots, Amazon parrots, and macaws are commonly diagnosed. Young, stressed, or immunocompromised birds are at greater risk. Aspergillosis-related air sacculitis is particularly common in African grey parrots.

## Causes

- **Fungal infections**: *Aspergillus fumigatus* is the most common and most serious cause. Fungal plaques and granulomas can form within the air sacs.
- **Bacterial infections**: Gram-negative bacteria such as *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*, and *Pasteurella* can infect air sacs.
- **Chlamydiosis**: *Chlamydia psittaci* can involve the air sacs.
- **Mycobacteriosis**: *Mycobacterium avium* can cause granulomatous air sacculitis.
- **Viral infections**: Some viral diseases can cause secondary air sacculitis.
- **Predisposing factors**: Poor ventilation, immunosuppression, chronic stress, malnutrition, prolonged antibiotic use, and exposure to moldy environments.

## Symptoms

- Labored breathing (dyspnea) with tail bobbing
- Open-mouth breathing
- Increased respiratory rate
- Exercise intolerance
- Voice changes or loss of vocalization
- Lethargy and decreased appetite
- Weight loss
- Cyanosis (bluish discoloration) of the feet or skin in severe cases
- Respiratory clicking or wheezing sounds

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Auscultation may reveal abnormal respiratory sounds.
- **Radiographs**: Can show increased opacity of air sacs, thickened air sac membranes, or granulomas.
- **CT scan**: Provides detailed assessment of air sac involvement.
- **Endoscopy**: Direct visualization of air sacs allows biopsy and sample collection. This is the gold standard for diagnosis.
- **Culture and sensitivity**: Of air sac aspirates or swabs obtained via endoscopy.
- **Fungal testing**: Aspergillus antigen and antibody testing.
- **Complete blood count and biochemistry**: To assess overall health and immune response.

## Treatment

- **Antifungal therapy**: For aspergillosis, treatment typically involves itraconazole, voriconazole, or amphotericin B. Nebulization with antifungal agents may be used as adjunct therapy.
- **Antibiotics**: Selected based on culture and sensitivity results for bacterial infections.
- **Nebulization**: Delivery of antifungals or antibiotics directly into the respiratory system via nebulization.
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, warmth, nutritional support, and stress reduction.
- **Surgical debridement**: Endoscopic removal of fungal plaques or granulomas in accessible locations.
- **Immunosupport**: Addressing underlying nutritional deficiencies and environmental stressors.

## Prevention

- Maintain clean, well-ventilated environments with low dust and no mold exposure.
- Avoid damp, musty bedding materials and keep food storage areas dry.
- Feed a nutritionally balanced diet to support immune function.
- Minimize stress from overcrowding, frequent changes, or inappropriate social conditions.
- Quarantine and screen new birds before introduction.

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies depending on the underlying cause and extent of involvement. Bacterial air sacculitis caught early may respond well to appropriate antibiotics. Aspergillosis-related air sacculitis carries a guarded to poor prognosis, particularly if the infection is widespread. Early detection and aggressive treatment improve outcomes significantly.
