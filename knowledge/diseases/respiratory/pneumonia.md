# Pneumonia in Parrots

## Overview

Pneumonia in parrots is an infection or inflammation of the lung tissue that represents one of the most serious respiratory conditions in avian medicine. The avian respiratory system differs fundamentally from mammals in that bird lungs are rigid and do not expand. Air flows through the lungs in a unidirectional pattern via the air sac system. When the lungs become infected, gas exchange is severely compromised, and the bird can deteriorate rapidly. Pneumonia in parrots should always be treated as a medical emergency.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to pneumonia. Amazon parrots, African grey parrots, macaws, and cockatoos are frequently affected. Neonatal and young birds, geriatric birds, and immunocompromised individuals are at highest risk.

## Causes

- **Bacterial**: *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*, *Pasteurella*, *Chlamydia psittaci*, and *Mycobacterium* species.
- **Fungal**: *Aspergillus fumigatus* is a major cause of fungal pneumonia, especially in immunosuppressed birds.
- **Viral**: Paramyxovirus, proventricular dilatation disease virus (avian bornavirus), and psittacine herpesvirus.
- **Aspiration**: Inhalation of food, water, or hand-feeding formula into the lungs. Common in hand-fed chicks.
- **Toxic inhalation**: Teflon (PTFE) fumes, smoke, aerosols, and other aerosolized toxins.
- **Predisposing factors**: Vitamin A deficiency, chronic stress, poor ventilation, and concurrent illness.

## Symptoms

- Severe respiratory distress with tail bobbing
- Open-mouth breathing
- Rapid or labored breathing (dyspnea)
- Lethargy and fluffed appearance
- Loss of appetite
- Nasal discharge
- Audible wheezing, clicking, or crackling sounds
- Cyanosis of feet and skin
- Sitting on the cage floor (too weak to perch)
- Sudden death in acute cases

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Auscultation revealing abnormal lung sounds.
- **Radiographs**: Show increased lung density, air sac opacification, or consolidation patterns.
- **CT scan**: Advanced imaging for detailed assessment of lung involvement.
- **Tracheal wash or lavage**: For cytology, culture, and sensitivity testing.
- **Complete blood count**: Typically shows elevated white blood cells with heterophilia.
- **Blood chemistry**: To assess organ function and overall health.
- **PCR testing**: For specific pathogens such as *Chlamydia psittaci* or avian bornavirus.
- **Aspergillus testing**: Serology and antigen testing if fungal pneumonia is suspected.

## Treatment

Pneumonia requires aggressive, immediate treatment:

- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen via an oxygen cage or incubator is often critical.
- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated immediately, then adjusted based on culture results. Common choices include enrofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or trimethoprim-sulfa.
- **Antifungals**: Voriconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B for fungal pneumonia.
- **Nebulization**: Delivery of saline, antibiotics, or antifungals directly to the respiratory tract.
- **Supportive care**: IV or subcutaneous fluids, heat support (brooder at 85-90F), nutritional support via gavage feeding if needed.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam to reduce inflammation and discomfort.
- **Hospitalization**: Severe cases require intensive veterinary hospitalization.

## Prevention

- Maintain excellent air quality with proper ventilation and air filtration.
- Never use Teflon-coated cookware or appliances near birds.
- Feed a balanced diet with adequate vitamin A.
- Use proper hand-feeding technique in chicks to prevent aspiration.
- Quarantine new birds and test for infectious diseases.
- Avoid exposure to smoke, aerosols, and chemical fumes.
- Schedule regular veterinary wellness exams.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause, severity, and speed of treatment. Bacterial pneumonia caught early responds well to appropriate antibiotics, carrying a fair to good prognosis. Aspiration pneumonia carries a guarded prognosis. Fungal pneumonia (aspergillosis) has a guarded to poor prognosis, particularly when diagnosis is delayed. Toxic inhalation pneumonia depends on the extent of lung damage. In all cases, early detection and aggressive treatment are essential for survival.
