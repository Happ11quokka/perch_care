# Sinusitis (Infraorbital Sinus Infection)

## Overview

Sinusitis in parrots is an infection or inflammation of the infraorbital sinuses, which are large, air-filled cavities located below and around the eyes. Because avian sinuses are extensive and poorly drained compared to mammalian sinuses, infections can become chronic and difficult to resolve. The infraorbital sinus connects to the nasal cavity, oral cavity, and cerebebral air spaces, meaning infection can spread to multiple areas of the head.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible, but sinusitis is particularly common in Amazon parrots, macaws, African grey parrots, and cockatiels. Species kept in dusty or poorly ventilated environments are at higher risk.

## Causes

- **Bacterial infections**: Commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria such as *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella*, *Pseudomonas*, and *Pasteurella*. *Mycoplasma* is also a significant cause.
- **Fungal infections**: *Aspergillus* species can invade the sinuses, particularly in immunocompromised birds.
- **Chlamydiosis**: *Chlamydia psittaci* frequently causes upper respiratory and sinus infections.
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Causes squamous metaplasia of sinus epithelium, predisposing to secondary infections.
- **Environmental irritants**: Cigarette smoke, aerosols, and dusty conditions.

## Symptoms

- Swelling around one or both eyes (periorbital swelling)
- Nasal discharge (serous, mucoid, or caseous)
- Sneezing and head shaking
- Ocular discharge or conjunctivitis
- Decreased appetite
- Difficulty breathing if swelling is severe
- Caseous (cheese-like) material accumulating in the sinus

## Diagnosis

- Physical examination revealing periorbital swelling
- Sinus aspirate for cytology and culture/sensitivity testing
- Radiographs or CT scan to assess extent of infection
- Chlamydia testing (PCR) to rule out chlamydiosis
- Blood work to evaluate systemic health

## Treatment

- **Sinus flush**: Saline or medicated flush through the infraorbital sinus to remove accumulated debris and caseous material. Often requires repeated treatments.
- **Systemic antibiotics**: Selected based on culture and sensitivity results. Common choices include enrofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfa, or doxycycline.
- **Antifungals**: If *Aspergillus* is identified, itraconazole or voriconazole may be prescribed.
- **Vitamin A supplementation**: If deficiency is suspected.
- **Surgical debridement**: In severe chronic cases with caseous material that cannot be flushed.

## Prevention

- Ensure adequate dietary vitamin A through dark leafy greens, sweet potatoes, and red/orange vegetables.
- Maintain clean, well-ventilated environments free of cigarette smoke and aerosol sprays.
- Quarantine new birds and test for *Chlamydia psittaci*.
- Schedule regular veterinary examinations.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is good with early detection and appropriate treatment. Chronic sinusitis, especially with caseous material, may require prolonged therapy and repeated sinus flushes. Fungal sinusitis carries a more guarded prognosis.
