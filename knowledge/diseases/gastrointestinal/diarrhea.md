# Diarrhea in Parrots

## Overview

Diarrhea in parrots refers to the passage of abnormally loose or watery fecal matter. A critical distinction must be made between true diarrhea and polyuria. Normal bird droppings consist of three components: feces (the solid, coiled portion), urates (the white, chalky portion), and urine (the clear liquid). True diarrhea involves unformed, loose feces, while polyuria is an increase in the urine (liquid) component with normal-looking feces. Many bird owners mistake polyuria for diarrhea. Accurate identification is essential because the two conditions have different causes and treatments.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop diarrhea. It is commonly reported in budgerigars, cockatiels, Amazon parrots, African grey parrots, and conures.

## Causes

### True Diarrhea (Abnormal Feces)
- **Bacterial infections**: *E. coli*, *Salmonella*, *Clostridium*, *Campylobacter*, and other gram-negative bacteria.
- **Parasitic infections**: *Giardia*, roundworms, coccidia.
- **Viral infections**: Paramyxovirus, proventricular dilatation disease (avian bornavirus).
- **Fungal infections**: *Candida* overgrowth or other yeast/fungal organisms.
- **Diet changes**: Abrupt changes in diet can cause temporary loose droppings.
- **High-fruit diets**: Excess fruit consumption increases water content of droppings.
- **Toxins**: Heavy metals (lead, zinc), toxic plants, or chemicals.
- **Organ disease**: Liver disease, pancreatic disease, or intestinal tumors.
- **Antibiotic use**: Disruption of normal gut flora.

### Polyuria (Excess Urine, Normal Feces)
- High water intake or water-rich foods
- Egg laying (normal increase in water consumption)
- Stress or excitement
- Kidney disease
- Diabetes
- Hormonal changes

## Symptoms

- Loose, unformed, or watery fecal portion in droppings
- Increased frequency of droppings
- Abnormal color of feces (yellow, green, black, or bloody)
- Soiled vent feathers (pasting)
- Foul-smelling droppings
- Lethargy and fluffed feathers
- Decreased appetite
- Weight loss
- Dehydration
- Straining to defecate

## Diagnosis

- **Fecal examination**: Direct smear, flotation, and Gram stain to identify parasites, abnormal bacteria, and yeast.
- **Fecal culture and sensitivity**: To identify specific bacterial pathogens and appropriate antibiotics.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count and chemistry panel, including liver and kidney values.
- **Heavy metal levels**: Blood zinc and lead testing.
- **Radiographs**: To evaluate organ size and detect foreign bodies.
- **PCR testing**: For specific pathogens (*Chlamydia*, bornavirus, *Giardia*).
- **Cloacal swab**: For bacterial and viral testing.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying cause:

- **Fluid therapy**: Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to correct dehydration.
- **Antibiotics**: Based on fecal culture and sensitivity results.
- **Antiparasitic medications**: Fenbendazole for roundworms, metronidazole or ronidazole for *Giardia*.
- **Antifungals**: Nystatin or fluconazole for yeast overgrowth.
- **Probiotics**: To restore healthy gut flora, especially after antibiotic treatment.
- **Dietary management**: Transition to a bland, easy-to-digest diet. Reduce fruit intake if excessive.
- **Chelation therapy**: For heavy metal poisoning.
- **Supportive care**: Heat support, quiet environment, and stress reduction.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, species-appropriate diet (pellets with fresh vegetables).
- Maintain clean food and water dishes, changed daily.
- Practice good hygiene with regular cage cleaning.
- Quarantine new birds and perform fecal testing.
- Avoid access to toxic metals, plants, and chemicals.
- Make dietary changes gradually over 1-2 weeks.
- Schedule annual veterinary examinations with fecal testing.

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies widely depending on the cause. Diarrhea from dietary changes or mild infections typically resolves quickly with appropriate management and carries a good prognosis. Parasitic infections respond well to treatment. Diarrhea caused by organ disease or viral infections carries a more variable prognosis depending on severity and response to treatment. Prompt veterinary evaluation is important for persistent or severe diarrhea.
