# Crop Burns

## Overview

Crop burns are thermal injuries to the crop caused by hand-feeding formula that is heated to an excessively high temperature. This is one of the most common and preventable hand-feeding injuries in baby parrots. The hot formula causes necrosis (tissue death) of the crop wall and overlying skin. Over the following days to weeks, the necrotic tissue sloughs off, often creating a fistula -- an abnormal opening between the crop and the outside of the body through which food leaks. Crop burns require veterinary attention and typically necessitate surgical repair.

## Affected Species

Crop burns affect exclusively hand-fed parrot chicks of any species. All commonly hand-raised species are at risk, including macaws, cockatoos, African grey parrots, conures, cockatiels, and budgerigars. Larger chicks with bigger crops may sustain more extensive burns.

## Causes

- **Overheated formula**: Hand-feeding formula heated above 110-112F (43-44C) can cause thermal burns. Microwave heating creates dangerous hot spots within the formula even when the overall temperature seems acceptable.
- **Uneven heating**: Microwaving formula creates uneven temperatures with pockets of extremely hot liquid surrounded by cooler formula.
- **Failure to test temperature**: Not using a thermometer to verify formula temperature before feeding.
- **Inexperienced hand-feeders**: Lack of knowledge about proper formula preparation.

## Symptoms

- Initial symptoms may be subtle; the chick may cry or pull away during feeding.
- Reddened, discolored skin over the crop area within hours of the burn.
- Swelling and darkening of the skin over the crop.
- Reluctance to eat or reduced feeding response.
- Leaking of food through the crop wall (fistula formation) typically 3-7 days after the burn.
- Visible opening in the crop/skin with food visible or leaking.
- Weight loss and dehydration as food is lost through the fistula.
- Secondary infection at the burn site.

## Diagnosis

- **History**: Recent hand-feeding with potentially overheated formula.
- **Physical examination**: Visual inspection reveals characteristic skin discoloration and eventual fistula formation over the crop.
- **Crop palpation**: Thinning or perforation of the crop wall may be felt.
- **Assessment of fistula size and location**: To plan surgical repair.

## Treatment

- **Initial management (before fistula forms)**: Keep the chick warm, apply topical antimicrobial ointment, and feed smaller volumes more frequently to reduce crop distension.
- **Wound management**: Once necrotic tissue begins to slough, keep the area clean and prevent further contamination.
- **Surgical repair**: The definitive treatment is surgical closure of the fistula once the tissue margins are healthy and viable. The crop wall and skin are closed in separate layers. Surgery is typically performed 1-2 weeks after the initial burn, after all necrotic tissue has sloughed.
- **Antibiotics**: Systemic antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary infection.
- **Alternative feeding**: Tube feeding distal to the crop or supportive fluids may be necessary until surgical repair.
- **Pain management**: Analgesics such as meloxicam for comfort.

## Prevention

- **Always use a thermometer** to check formula temperature before every feeding. Formula should be 105-110F (40-43C).
- **Never microwave formula**. Instead, heat water in a separate container and place the formula container in the warm water bath.
- **Stir formula thoroughly** after heating to eliminate hot spots.
- **Test temperature on your wrist** as an additional safety check (should feel warm, not hot).
- **Educate all hand-feeders** on proper formula preparation and temperature safety.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally good with appropriate surgical repair. Most chicks recover fully after fistula closure and go on to wean normally. Small fistulas occasionally heal without surgery, but this is not reliable. Delayed treatment or severe burns involving large areas of the crop carry a more guarded prognosis, and the risk of secondary infection increases with time.
