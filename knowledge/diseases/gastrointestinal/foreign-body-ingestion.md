# Foreign Body Ingestion

## Overview

Foreign body ingestion occurs when a parrot swallows an indigestible object that becomes lodged in the crop, proventriculus, ventriculus, or intestines. Parrots are naturally curious and use their beaks to explore objects, making them prone to swallowing small items from their environment. Ingested foreign bodies can cause obstruction, perforation, or toxic reactions (in the case of metals). This condition ranges from mild to life-threatening depending on the type, size, and location of the object and requires prompt veterinary assessment.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible. Larger parrots such as macaws, cockatoos, and Amazon parrots may swallow larger objects, while smaller species like budgerigars, cockatiels, and lovebirds tend to ingest smaller items. Young, hand-raised birds and birds with insufficient environmental enrichment are at higher risk.

## Causes

- **Metallic objects**: Zinc-coated cage hardware, lead weights, jewelry, coins, bells, and zipper pulls. These cause both obstruction and heavy metal toxicosis.
- **Toy parts**: Small plastic or rubber components from bird toys that break apart.
- **Fabric and fibers**: Thread, rope fibers from toys, and fabric strips, especially from happy huts or tents.
- **Bedding material**: Young chicks may ingest substrate material.
- **Plant material**: Seeds, pits, or woody material that cannot be digested.
- **Household items**: Paper clips, buttons, beads, earring backs, and other small items.
- **String and linear foreign bodies**: Particularly dangerous as they can cause intestinal bunching and perforation.

## Symptoms

- Decreased appetite or refusal to eat
- Regurgitation or vomiting
- Crop distension or palpable mass in the crop
- Lethargy and fluffed feathers
- Straining to defecate or decreased/absent droppings
- Abdominal distension
- Weight loss
- Signs of heavy metal poisoning (if metallic object): seizures, weakness, green or bloody droppings, increased thirst
- Sudden behavioral changes or depression

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Crop palpation may reveal a foreign body. Abdominal palpation may detect distension.
- **Radiographs (X-rays)**: The primary diagnostic tool. Metallic objects are easily identified on radiographs. Non-metallic objects may be more difficult to visualize.
- **Contrast radiography (barium study)**: To identify non-radiopaque foreign bodies by outlining them with contrast dye and assessing GI transit time.
- **Fluoroscopy**: Real-time X-ray to assess GI motility and obstruction.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count, chemistry panel, and heavy metal levels (zinc, lead) if metallic ingestion is suspected.
- **Endoscopy**: Direct visualization of the crop or proventriculus to identify and potentially retrieve objects.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the type, size, and location of the foreign body:

- **Crop foreign bodies**: May be removed via crop lavage, endoscopic retrieval, or surgical ingluviotomy (crop incision).
- **Proventricular or ventricular foreign bodies**: Endoscopic retrieval if possible. Surgical removal (proventriculotomy or ventriculotomy) if endoscopy fails.
- **Intestinal foreign bodies**: Typically require surgical enterotomy for removal.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: Chelation therapy with calcium EDTA or D-penicillamine to bind and eliminate the metal, in addition to removing the source.
- **Supportive care**: Fluids, nutritional support, heat, and anti-nausea medication.
- **Antibiotics**: If perforation or secondary infection is suspected.
- **Monitoring**: Post-treatment radiographs to confirm complete removal.

## Prevention

- Inspect all bird toys regularly for loose parts, frayed rope, and breakable components. Replace damaged toys immediately.
- Use only bird-safe, stainless steel cage hardware. Avoid zinc-coated or galvanized materials.
- Remove small household items from the bird's environment (jewelry, coins, buttons, paper clips).
- Avoid fabric tents, happy huts, and rope perches that can be shredded and ingested.
- Supervise out-of-cage time carefully.
- Use appropriate chick bedding that cannot be easily ingested.
- Provide appropriate foraging toys and enrichment to reduce boredom-driven chewing.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is good when the foreign body is identified and removed promptly before perforation or severe toxicosis develops. Metallic foreign bodies with concurrent heavy metal poisoning carry a more guarded prognosis but respond well to chelation therapy when caught early. Intestinal perforation or prolonged obstruction significantly worsens the prognosis. Linear foreign bodies (string) can be particularly dangerous and carry a guarded prognosis.
