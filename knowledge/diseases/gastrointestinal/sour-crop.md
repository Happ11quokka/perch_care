# Sour Crop (Crop Impaction and Fermentation)

## Overview

Sour crop is a condition in which the crop becomes impacted or stagnant, leading to fermentation of its contents by bacteria and yeast. The name derives from the foul, sour smell that emanates from the bird's mouth and crop area due to microbial overgrowth in the stagnant food. The crop becomes distended with a mixture of fermented food, gas, and fluid. If left untreated, sour crop can lead to systemic infection, aspiration, and death. It is commonly associated with *Candida* yeast overgrowth and bacterial proliferation.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop sour crop. It is most frequently seen in hand-fed chicks, but also occurs in adult birds. Budgerigars, cockatiels, cockatoos, and macaws are commonly affected.

## Causes

- **Candida (yeast) overgrowth**: *Candida albicans* proliferates in stagnant crop contents, particularly after antibiotic use disrupts normal flora.
- **Bacterial overgrowth**: Gram-negative bacteria thrive in stagnant, fermenting crop contents.
- **Foreign body impaction**: Ingested bedding material, fabric, or indigestible objects causing obstruction.
- **Overfeeding**: Excessive formula volumes that exceed the crop's capacity to empty.
- **Cold formula**: Slows crop motility, allowing contents to stagnate.
- **Dehydration**: Insufficient fluid causes food to become dry and impacted.
- **Underlying illness**: Proventricular dilatation disease, crop atony, or systemic infection reducing GI motility.
- **Poor husbandry**: Dirty feeding equipment, contaminated formula, or improper food storage.

## Symptoms

- Distended, visibly full crop that fails to empty
- Foul, sour odor from the mouth and crop
- Regurgitation of foul-smelling crop contents
- Brownish or discolored fluid visible in the crop
- Decreased or absent feeding response (chicks)
- Weight loss
- Lethargy and fluffed feathers
- Dehydration
- White plaques in the mouth (if *Candida* is present)
- Crop feels doughy, firm, or fluid-filled on palpation

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation reveals a distended, often fluid-filled or doughy crop with a characteristic sour smell.
- **Crop aspirate/swab**: Gram stain showing budding yeast cells (*Candida*) or excessive bacteria.
- **Crop cytology**: Examination of crop contents for organisms.
- **Culture and sensitivity**: To identify specific bacterial pathogens.
- **Radiographs**: To rule out foreign bodies or obstruction.
- **Blood work**: To assess dehydration and systemic health.

## Treatment

- **Crop lavage**: The veterinarian empties the crop by gentle flushing with warm saline or dilute chlorhexidine solution to remove fermented contents. This may need to be repeated.
- **Antifungal therapy**: Nystatin (topical in the crop) for *Candida* overgrowth. Fluconazole for systemic yeast infections.
- **Antibiotics**: Selected based on culture results for bacterial involvement.
- **Motility agents**: Metoclopramide to restore normal crop emptying.
- **Rehydration**: Warm subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to correct dehydration.
- **Heat support**: Maintain proper environmental temperature.
- **Dietary management**: Small, frequent feedings of properly prepared formula at correct temperature.
- **Foreign body removal**: Surgical ingluviotomy if impaction is caused by foreign material.

## Prevention

- Always use clean, sterilized feeding equipment for hand-feeding.
- Prepare fresh formula for each feeding and discard leftovers.
- Feed formula at the correct temperature (105-110F).
- Do not overfeed; follow appropriate volume guidelines for the species and age.
- Monitor crop emptying between feedings and do not feed again until the crop is empty or nearly empty.
- Avoid unnecessary antibiotic use that can disrupt normal crop flora.
- Use appropriate bedding that cannot be easily ingested by chicks.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally good when sour crop is caught early and the underlying cause is addressed. Mild cases of *Candida* overgrowth respond well to antifungal therapy. Severe or chronic sour crop, especially with foreign body impaction or underlying systemic disease, carries a more guarded prognosis. Prompt veterinary intervention significantly improves outcomes.
