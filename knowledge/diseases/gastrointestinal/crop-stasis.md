# Crop Stasis (Slow Crop Emptying)

## Overview

Crop stasis, also known as delayed crop emptying or crop slowdown, occurs when the crop fails to empty at a normal rate. The crop is a muscular pouch in the esophagus that serves as a temporary food storage organ. In healthy birds, the crop should empty within 3-4 hours after feeding. When motility is impaired, food remains in the crop and can begin to ferment, leading to secondary bacterial or yeast infections. Crop stasis is not a disease itself but rather a symptom of an underlying condition that requires thorough investigation.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop crop stasis. It is especially common in hand-fed chicks (neonates) but also occurs in adult birds. Macaws, cockatoos, African grey parrots, and budgerigars are frequently affected.

## Causes

- **Infections**: Bacterial infections (gram-negative organisms), fungal infections (especially *Candida albicans*), and viral infections (avian polyomavirus, proventricular dilatation disease/avian bornavirus).
- **Crop foreign bodies**: Ingestion of bedding material, fabric fibers, or other indigestible objects.
- **Cold food in chicks**: Hand-feeding formula that is too cold slows crop motility.
- **Overfeeding**: Excessive volume during hand-feeding distends and weakens the crop.
- **Toxins**: Heavy metal poisoning (zinc, lead) can cause GI stasis.
- **Systemic illness**: Liver disease, kidney disease, or any serious illness can reduce crop function.
- **Dehydration**: Inadequate fluid intake reduces crop motility.
- **Crop burns**: Damage to crop tissue from hot formula impairs motility.

## Symptoms

- Crop remains full or distended for extended periods
- Food visible in crop well past normal emptying time
- Regurgitation or vomiting
- Decreased appetite or refusal to eat
- Weight loss
- Lethargy and fluffed feathers
- Foul odor from the mouth (if fermentation occurs)
- Doughy or thickened crop wall on palpation

## Diagnosis

- **Crop palpation**: Assessing crop size, consistency, and contents. A distended crop with doughy or liquid contents is suggestive.
- **Crop aspirate/swab**: Gram stain and culture to identify bacterial or yeast infections.
- **Radiographs**: To detect foreign bodies, assess crop size, and evaluate the proventriculus and ventriculus.
- **Contrast radiography (barium study)**: To assess GI transit time and identify obstructions.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count and chemistry panel to evaluate systemic health.
- **Heavy metal testing**: Blood zinc and lead levels if toxicosis is suspected.
- **Bornavirus testing**: PCR or serology if proventricular dilatation disease is suspected.

## Treatment

Treatment focuses on identifying and addressing the underlying cause:

- **Crop emptying**: Gentle crop massage or veterinary-guided crop lavage to remove stagnant contents.
- **Rehydration**: Warm electrolyte fluids administered via crop or subcutaneously.
- **Antibiotics/antifungals**: Based on crop cytology and culture results. Nystatin for *Candida* overgrowth.
- **Motility agents**: Metoclopramide or cisapride may be used to promote crop motility.
- **Heat support**: Maintaining appropriate environmental temperature, especially in chicks.
- **Dietary adjustment**: Smaller, more frequent feedings. Ensure hand-feeding formula is at proper temperature (105-110F).
- **Surgery**: If foreign body obstruction is identified.

## Prevention

- Follow proper hand-feeding technique with correct formula temperature and volume.
- Use appropriate bedding for chicks (avoid substrates that can be ingested).
- Maintain clean feeding equipment to prevent infections.
- Ensure adult birds have a balanced diet and clean water.
- Remove small objects and toxic metals from the bird's environment.
- Monitor crop emptying times in hand-fed chicks after every feeding.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends entirely on the underlying cause. Simple crop stasis from cold formula or mild infection responds well to treatment with a good prognosis. Crop stasis caused by avian bornavirus (proventricular dilatation disease) carries a guarded to poor prognosis. Foreign body cases have a good prognosis if identified and removed promptly.
