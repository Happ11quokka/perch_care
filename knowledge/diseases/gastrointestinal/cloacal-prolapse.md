# Cloacal Prolapse

## Overview

Cloacal prolapse occurs when the tissue lining the cloaca (the common chamber for the digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts in birds) protrudes outward through the vent opening. The prolapsed tissue appears as a pink, red, or dark mass protruding from the vent area. This is a medical emergency requiring immediate veterinary care, as the exposed tissue can rapidly become dried out, traumatized, infected, or necrotic. If other birds are present, they may peck at the prolapsed tissue, causing further damage.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can experience cloacal prolapse. It is most commonly seen in cockatiels, budgerigars, cockatoos, and Amazon parrots. Chronic egg-laying hens and birds with cloacal papillomas are at elevated risk.

## Causes

- **Straining from egg laying**: Especially in cases of egg binding or chronic egg laying.
- **Cloacal papillomas**: Papillomavirus-related growths in the cloaca that can lead to prolapse.
- **Chronic straining**: From constipation, diarrhea, or internal masses.
- **Cloacal infections**: Bacterial or fungal infections causing inflammation and swelling.
- **Reproductive disease**: Oviductal prolapse can appear as cloacal prolapse.
- **Malnutrition**: Calcium deficiency weakens cloacal muscles and tissues.
- **Obesity**: Excess fat deposits in the abdomen increase pressure on the cloaca.
- **Masses or tumors**: Abdominal masses that create pressure on the cloaca.
- **Masturbation/hormonal behavior**: Chronic sexual stimulation causing straining.

## Symptoms

- Visible pink, red, or dark tissue protruding from the vent
- Straining or tenesmus (repeated attempts to defecate or lay an egg)
- Blood on or around the vent
- Soiled vent feathers
- Inability to pass droppings normally
- Lethargy and discomfort
- Decreased appetite
- Other birds pecking at the prolapsed tissue

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Visual identification of protruding tissue.
- **Tissue identification**: Determining whether the prolapse involves the cloaca, oviduct, or intestine.
- **Radiographs**: To check for eggs, masses, or organ enlargement.
- **Blood work**: Calcium levels, complete blood count, and chemistry panel.
- **Biopsy**: Of papilloma-like tissue for histopathology.
- **Cloacal culture**: If infection is suspected.

## Treatment

This is an emergency. First aid measures should be initiated immediately:

- **Keep tissue moist**: Apply sterile saline, water-based lubricant, or sugar water (hypertonic solution to reduce swelling) to the prolapsed tissue. Do not allow it to dry out.
- **Prevent self-trauma**: Use an Elizabethan collar if the bird is pecking at the tissue.
- **Veterinary reduction**: The veterinarian will gently clean and replace the prolapsed tissue, often using lubrication and gentle pressure. A purse-string suture around the vent may be placed to prevent recurrence while allowing passage of droppings.
- **Address underlying cause**: Treat egg binding, infections, papillomas, or other contributing conditions.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam to reduce swelling and pain.
- **Antibiotics**: If secondary infection is present.
- **Calcium supplementation**: If deficiency is identified.
- **Surgery**: For recurrent prolapse, cloacal papillomas, or when tissue is severely damaged or necrotic, surgical intervention may be necessary, including cloacopexy (surgical fixation of the cloaca).

## Prevention

- Address chronic egg-laying behavior with environmental and hormonal management.
- Maintain adequate dietary calcium levels.
- Keep birds at a healthy weight.
- Treat cloacal infections promptly.
- Regular veterinary examinations to detect predisposing conditions early.
- Minimize hormonal stimulation that promotes egg laying.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the duration of prolapse and the underlying cause. Fresh prolapse that is reduced quickly carries a good prognosis. Prolapse with devitalized or necrotic tissue has a more guarded prognosis. Recurrence is common if the underlying cause is not addressed. Cases associated with cloacal papillomas may recur and require ongoing management.
