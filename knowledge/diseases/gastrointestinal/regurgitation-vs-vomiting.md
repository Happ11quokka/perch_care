# Regurgitation vs. Vomiting in Parrots

## Overview

Distinguishing between regurgitation and vomiting is one of the most important diagnostic distinctions in avian medicine. Regurgitation is a voluntary, controlled act that is often a normal behavioral response, while vomiting is an involuntary expulsion of crop or stomach contents that indicates illness. Because the physical act can appear similar to an untrained observer, understanding the behavioral context and physical signs that differentiate the two is essential for proper assessment.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can exhibit both regurgitation and vomiting. Regurgitation as a normal behavior is common in budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, conures, and larger parrots like macaws and cockatoos.

## Causes

### Normal Regurgitation (Behavioral)
- **Courtship and pair bonding**: Regurgitation to a mate or perceived mate (including owners, toys, or mirrors) is a normal expression of affection and bonding.
- **Parental feeding**: Parent birds regurgitate food to feed chicks.
- **Excitement**: Some birds regurgitate when excited or overstimulated.

### Pathological Vomiting
- **Infections**: Bacterial, fungal (*Candida*), or viral infections of the crop, proventriculus, or ventriculus.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: Lead or zinc poisoning is a common cause of vomiting.
- **Proventricular dilatation disease (PDD)**: Caused by avian bornavirus.
- **Foreign body ingestion**: Obstruction in the GI tract.
- **Liver or kidney disease**: Organ dysfunction can cause nausea and vomiting.
- **Toxin ingestion**: Plants, household chemicals, or contaminated food.
- **Crop disorders**: Crop stasis, sour crop, or crop infections.
- **Medication side effects**: Some drugs can cause GI upset.

## Symptoms

### Normal Regurgitation
- Deliberate, rhythmic bobbing of the head in an up-and-down motion
- Food is brought up in an organized manner, often deposited on a specific object, mate, or owner
- Bird appears otherwise healthy, alert, and active
- No food stuck to the head feathers
- Occurs in a social context (bonding behavior)
- Bird is not distressed

### Pathological Vomiting
- Forceful, side-to-side head shaking that flings food material
- Food is scattered on the head feathers, cage walls, and surrounding area
- Bird appears lethargic, fluffed, or depressed
- May be accompanied by weight loss
- Occurs regardless of social context
- Food may contain mucus, blood, or abnormal color
- Repeated episodes without behavioral trigger
- Crop may be distended or foul-smelling

## Diagnosis

When vomiting (not behavioral regurgitation) is identified:

- **History**: Frequency, duration, context, diet, and environmental exposure.
- **Physical examination**: Crop palpation, body weight, hydration status.
- **Crop aspirate**: Gram stain and culture for infections.
- **Radiographs**: To detect foreign bodies, organ enlargement, or heavy metals.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood count, chemistry panel, and heavy metal levels (zinc, lead).
- **Fecal analysis**: For parasites and abnormal bacteria.
- **Bornavirus testing**: If PDD is suspected.

## Treatment

- **Normal regurgitation**: No medical treatment needed. If excessive or directed at owners, reduce stimulating behaviors (petting the back, prolonged cuddling) and remove mirror/toy triggers.
- **Pathological vomiting**: Treat the underlying cause:
  - **Anti-nausea medication**: Metoclopramide or ondansetron.
  - **Antibiotics/antifungals**: Based on culture results.
  - **Chelation therapy**: For heavy metal poisoning (calcium EDTA).
  - **Supportive care**: Fluids, heat support, nutritional support.
  - **Surgery**: For foreign body removal if indicated.

## Prevention

- Keep the bird's environment free of small metal objects, toxic plants, and harmful chemicals.
- Feed a balanced, clean diet.
- Understand normal bonding behaviors to avoid unnecessary alarm.
- Schedule regular veterinary check-ups.
- Monitor for changes in behavior or appetite that may signal illness.

## Prognosis

Normal regurgitation requires no treatment and has no health implications. Pathological vomiting prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Infections generally respond well to treatment. Heavy metal toxicosis has a fair to good prognosis with prompt chelation. PDD carries a guarded to poor long-term prognosis.
