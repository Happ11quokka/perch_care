# Heavy Metal Neuropathy in Parrots

## Overview

Heavy metal neuropathy refers to neurological damage caused by the ingestion and accumulation of toxic metals, primarily lead and zinc, in parrots. These metals exert toxic effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems, causing a range of neurological signs including tremors, blindness, seizures, and ataxia. Heavy metal neuropathy is one of the most common toxicological emergencies in pet birds and requires urgent veterinary intervention for a successful outcome.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to heavy metal neuropathy. Amazon Parrots, cockatoos, macaws, and African Grey Parrots are frequently affected due to their strong beaks and natural curiosity, which predispose them to chewing on metallic objects. Smaller species such as budgerigars and cockatiels can also be affected, often with more rapid onset of severe signs due to their smaller body mass.

## Causes

- **Lead sources**: Old paint and paint chips, stained glass, lead-containing solder, fishing weights, curtain weights, certain costume jewelry, ammunition, and vintage cage hardware
- **Zinc sources**: Galvanized wire and cage components, pennies minted after 1982, zinc-coated hardware and bolts, certain padlocks and quick-links, and some rubber-coated items
- **Route of exposure**: Oral ingestion through chewing and swallowing metallic fragments or particles

## Symptoms

Neurological signs may develop acutely or gradually depending on the amount and duration of exposure:

- Tremors, particularly of the head and wings
- Seizures ranging from mild twitching to full tonic-clonic episodes
- Ataxia and loss of coordination
- Blindness (partial or complete)
- Head tilt and circling
- Leg weakness or paralysis
- Depression, lethargy, and fluffed appearance
- Concurrent gastrointestinal signs: regurgitation, crop stasis, dark or bloody droppings
- Polyuria and polydipsia (increased urination and thirst)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis involves a combination of history, clinical signs, and diagnostics. Whole-body radiographs are essential to identify metallic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract, which appear as bright radio-dense objects. Blood lead and zinc levels confirm exposure and toxicity. A complete blood count may reveal changes in red blood cells. Blood chemistry panels help assess organ damage, particularly kidney and liver function. Lead levels above 20 mcg/dL are considered toxic, while zinc levels above 200 mcg/dL indicate toxicosis.

## Treatment

- **Chelation therapy**: Calcium disodium EDTA (CaEDTA) is the primary chelating agent, administered by injection. DMSA (succimer) is an oral chelating agent used as a follow-up or alternative
- **Removal of metal**: Endoscopic or surgical removal of metallic foreign bodies from the GI tract may be necessary. Bulk-forming agents can assist passage of small fragments
- **Seizure control**: Diazepam or midazolam for active seizures
- **Supportive care**: IV or subcutaneous fluids, nutritional support, warmth, and anti-nausea medications
- **Repeated monitoring**: Serial blood metal levels and radiographs to confirm clearance

## Prevention

- Use only stainless steel or powder-coated hardware in and around cages
- Remove all sources of lead and zinc from the bird's environment
- Avoid galvanized wire for cage construction or play areas
- Inspect toys and cage accessories for zinc-coated components
- Keep birds away from old paint, curtain weights, and costume jewelry
- Perform regular environmental audits for metal hazards

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity of exposure and how quickly treatment is initiated. Birds treated early before significant neurological damage occurs often recover well with chelation therapy. However, prolonged or severe exposure may result in permanent neurological deficits, including blindness or chronic ataxia. Seizures that are controlled quickly carry a better prognosis than status epilepticus. Fatal outcomes are possible if treatment is delayed or metal sources are not fully removed.
