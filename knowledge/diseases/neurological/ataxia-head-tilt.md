# Ataxia and Head Tilt in Parrots

## Overview

Ataxia refers to a loss of coordination and balance, while head tilt (torticollis) is an abnormal tilting or rotation of the head to one side. These neurological signs indicate dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, inner ear, or peripheral nerves. Both conditions require thorough diagnostic workup to identify the underlying cause, as they are symptoms rather than a disease in themselves.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop ataxia and head tilt. Cockatiels, budgerigars, and Amazon Parrots are frequently presented with these signs. African Grey Parrots are susceptible due to their predisposition to hypocalcemia-related neurological dysfunction. Macaws and conures may develop these signs in association with Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD).

## Causes

- **Inner ear infection**: Bacterial or fungal otitis media/interna causing vestibular dysfunction
- **Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)**: Avian bornavirus affecting the central nervous system
- **Heavy metal poisoning**: Lead and zinc toxicity causing neuropathy
- **Head trauma**: Impact injuries from falls, window strikes, or animal attacks
- **Vitamin E or selenium deficiency**: Causing encephalomalacia
- **Stroke or vascular events**: Cerebrovascular accidents
- **Tumors**: Intracranial neoplasia pressing on brain structures
- **Chlamydiosis**: Systemic infection involving the nervous system
- **Aspergillosis**: Fungal granulomas affecting the brain

## Symptoms

- Inability to maintain balance on perch or flat surfaces
- Head tilting to one side, sometimes with circling
- Uncoordinated walking, stumbling, or falling
- Nystagmus (rapid involuntary eye movement)
- Inability to fly or uncoordinated flight
- Difficulty grasping food or perches
- Disorientation and confusion
- Tremors or involuntary head bobbing

## Diagnosis

A comprehensive diagnostic approach is essential. This includes physical and neurological examination, complete blood count and blood chemistry panel, heavy metal levels (lead and zinc), whole-body radiographs, and infectious disease testing including PCR for avian bornavirus and Chlamydia psittaci. Advanced imaging with CT or MRI may be needed to evaluate intracranial structures. Otoscopic examination can help identify middle or inner ear disease. Endoscopy and crop biopsy may be indicated for PDD diagnosis.

## Treatment

Treatment targets the underlying cause. Inner ear infections require systemic antibiotics or antifungals for extended courses. PDD management involves anti-inflammatory therapy (NSAIDs such as meloxicam) and supportive care, though no cure exists. Heavy metal toxicity is treated with chelation therapy. Head trauma patients receive anti-inflammatory medication, supportive care, and cage rest. Nutritional deficiencies are corrected through diet improvement and supplementation. Physical therapy and environmental modifications, such as lowered perches and padded cage floors, help prevent injury during recovery.

## Prevention

- Maintain a nutritionally complete diet with adequate vitamins and minerals
- Remove heavy metal sources from the environment
- Provide safe cage and flight environments to prevent head trauma
- Quarantine and test new birds for infectious diseases
- Schedule regular veterinary wellness exams

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends heavily on the underlying cause. Inner ear infections often respond well to appropriate antimicrobial therapy with good outcomes. PDD-related neurological signs are typically progressive with a guarded long-term prognosis. Head trauma cases may recover if brain damage is not severe. Heavy metal neuropathy can improve significantly with prompt chelation therapy.
