# Seizures in Parrots

## Overview

Seizures are involuntary, uncontrolled bursts of electrical activity in the brain that result in sudden changes in behavior, movement, and consciousness. In parrots, seizures constitute a veterinary emergency and can manifest as falling off perches, uncontrolled wing flapping, leg paddling, loss of consciousness, and muscle rigidity. Seizures may be isolated events or occur in clusters, and identifying the underlying cause is critical for effective treatment.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can experience seizures, though African Grey Parrots are particularly susceptible due to their predisposition to hypocalcemia. Eclectus Parrots, cockatoos, and Amazon Parrots are also commonly affected. Young birds may experience seizures related to polyomavirus or other infectious causes.

## Causes

- **Hypocalcemia**: Low blood calcium is one of the most common causes, especially in African Grey Parrots
- **Toxin exposure**: Lead and zinc poisoning, PTFE (Teflon) fume exposure, and pesticide ingestion
- **Infectious diseases**: Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD), psittacosis, aspergillosis, and viral encephalitis
- **Head trauma**: Falls, collisions with windows or walls, and attacks by other animals
- **Metabolic disorders**: Liver disease, kidney failure, and hypoglycemia
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin E, thiamine, or calcium deficiency
- **Epilepsy**: Idiopathic seizures with no identifiable cause (rare in birds)

## Symptoms

- Sudden falling from perch
- Uncontrolled wing flapping and leg paddling
- Muscle rigidity or tremors
- Loss of consciousness or unresponsiveness
- Disorientation and ataxia following the episode
- Vocalization during the seizure event
- Post-ictal phase: lethargy and confusion lasting minutes to hours

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis requires a thorough veterinary workup including complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistry panel with calcium and uric acid levels, whole-body radiographs to check for metal foreign bodies, and heavy metal blood levels (lead, zinc). Advanced diagnostics may include CT or MRI imaging, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and infectious disease testing (PCR for PDD, Chlamydia).

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Immediate stabilization includes administering diazepam or midazolam to stop active seizures. Hypocalcemia is treated with injectable calcium gluconate. Heavy metal poisoning requires chelation therapy with CaEDTA or DMSA. Infections are treated with appropriate antimicrobials. Supportive care includes fluid therapy, warmth, and a quiet, dark environment during recovery.

## Prevention

- Provide a nutritionally complete diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D3
- Remove all sources of heavy metals from the bird's environment
- Eliminate exposure to toxic fumes, chemicals, and plants
- Ensure safe flight environments to prevent head trauma
- Schedule regular veterinary checkups with blood work

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies widely depending on the underlying cause. Seizures caused by hypocalcemia often respond well to supplementation with a good prognosis. Toxin-related seizures may resolve with chelation therapy if caught early. Seizures due to advanced PDD or severe metabolic disease carry a more guarded prognosis. Repeated or prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) without intervention can be fatal.
