# Feather Cysts

## Overview

Feather cysts (also called feather follicle cysts or feather folliculomas) are benign growths that form when a developing feather is unable to break through the skin surface and instead curls and grows beneath the skin within the feather follicle. The trapped feather and associated keratin material accumulate inside the follicle, forming a progressively enlarging, firm, oval mass under the skin. Feather cysts can be single or multiple and may recur after treatment. While they are not typically life-threatening, they can become large, uncomfortable, and prone to secondary infection if they rupture.

## Affected Species

Feather cysts are most commonly seen in canaries, where they are a well-recognized hereditary condition, particularly in Norwich, Gloucester, and other "feather type" canary breeds selected for heavy, soft feathering. In parrots, feather cysts occur less frequently but have been reported in budgerigars, cockatiels, macaws, and other species. They can affect any feathered area of the body but are most common on the wings.

## Causes

- **Genetic predisposition**: In canaries, a hereditary basis is well established. Selective breeding for abundant, soft feathering increases susceptibility.
- **Feather follicle trauma**: Physical damage to the follicle can cause abnormal feather growth direction.
- **Chronic feather damage**: Repeated feather pulling or damage to the same follicle.
- **Infection**: Bacterial or viral infection of the follicle can alter feather growth.
- **Malnutrition**: Nutritional deficiencies affecting feather development.
- **Viral disease**: Circovirus (PBFD) and polyomavirus can cause abnormal feather growth patterns that may contribute to cyst formation.

## Symptoms

- Firm, smooth, oval lumps under the skin, most commonly on the wings or body
- Gradual increase in size over time as feather material accumulates
- Yellowish or waxy appearance of the cyst when viewed through the skin
- Possible rupture with discharge of cheesy, yellowish-white keratin material
- Bleeding if the cyst ruptures or is traumatized
- Secondary infection if the cyst becomes open or contaminated
- Multiple cysts may be present simultaneously
- Discomfort or irritation causing the bird to pick at the area

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation of characteristic firm, subcutaneous masses along feather tracts, most commonly on the wings.
- **Fine needle aspirate**: Aspiration of cyst contents reveals keratin and feather material.
- **Histopathology**: Biopsy and microscopic examination of the cyst wall and contents confirm the diagnosis and rule out neoplasia.
- **Radiographs**: May be useful to assess the extent of cysts and rule out bony involvement.
- **Viral testing**: PBFD and polyomavirus testing if viral cause is suspected.

## Treatment

- **Surgical excision**: The definitive treatment. The entire cyst, including the follicle wall, must be removed to prevent recurrence. This is performed under general anesthesia.
- **Incision and drainage**: A temporary measure that removes the accumulated material but typically results in recurrence because the abnormal follicle remains intact.
- **Cauterization**: Chemical (silver nitrate) or thermal cauterization of the follicle after drainage may reduce recurrence.
- **Laser ablation**: CO2 laser can be used to ablate the cyst and follicle lining.
- **Multiple cyst management**: For birds with extensive cysts, staged surgical procedures may be necessary.
- **Antibiotics**: If secondary infection is present.
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam following surgical procedures.

## Prevention

- **Responsible breeding**: In canaries, avoid breeding two heavily feathered (buff) birds together, as this increases the incidence of feather cysts in offspring.
- **Genetic selection**: Do not breed affected individuals, as the trait is hereditary.
- **Balanced nutrition**: Ensure adequate protein, vitamins, and minerals for healthy feather development.
- **Minimize feather trauma**: Prevent feather picking and physical damage to feather follicles.
- **Regular examination**: Monitor birds for early cyst development and seek treatment before cysts become large.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is generally good for individual feather cysts treated with complete surgical excision. Recurrence at the same site is possible if the entire follicle is not removed. Birds with a genetic predisposition (particularly canaries) may develop new cysts at other follicle sites over time, requiring ongoing monitoring and potential additional surgeries. Feather cysts do not metastasize or become malignant. Quality of life is usually maintained with appropriate management.
