# French Molt

## Overview

French molt is a feather disorder primarily associated with avian polyomavirus (APV) infection, most commonly seen in budgerigars (parakeets). The condition is characterized by the loss or failure to develop flight feathers and tail feathers in young birds shortly after they leave the nest. The name "French molt" originated historically from French budgerigar breeders who first described the condition. Affected birds, often called "runners" or "crawlers," are unable to fly and move around by running and climbing. The disease ranges from mild feather abnormalities to acute, fatal polyomavirus infection in very young chicks.

## Affected Species

French molt is most classically described in budgerigars, where it is extremely common in aviary settings. However, avian polyomavirus can affect a wide range of parrot species. In non-budgerigar psittacines, the virus tends to cause acute, often fatal disease in nestlings rather than the chronic feather disorder. Species susceptible to polyomavirus include macaws, conures, eclectus parrots, cockatoos, lovebirds, and ring-necked parakeets.

## Causes

- **Avian polyomavirus (APV)**: Also known as budgerigar fledgling disease virus. This is the primary viral agent responsible for French molt.
- **Mode of transmission**: The virus is spread through feather dust, fecal material, and direct contact. It can persist in the environment for extended periods.
- **Vertical transmission**: Possible from infected parents to eggs.
- **Immune status**: The severity of disease depends on the chick's immune status at the time of exposure. Very young chicks with immature immune systems develop the most severe disease.
- **Concurrent stressors**: Poor nutrition, overcrowding, and unsanitary conditions worsen outcomes.
- **Carrier birds**: Adult budgerigars can be asymptomatic carriers, shedding the virus intermittently.

## Symptoms

### Classic French Molt (Budgerigars)
- Loss of primary flight feathers and tail feathers in fledgling birds (around 4-6 weeks of age)
- Feathers either fail to grow or grow abnormally and fall out
- Feathers that grow may be dystrophic (misshapen, blood-filled, or fragile)
- Affected birds cannot fly ("runners" or "crawlers")
- Body contour feathers may also be affected to varying degrees
- Birds are otherwise often alert and active

### Acute Polyomavirus (Non-Budgerigar Psittacines and Young Chicks)
- Sudden death in nestlings (often 10-25 days old)
- Crop stasis and delayed crop emptying
- Subcutaneous hemorrhages (bruising under the skin)
- Abdominal distension
- Tremors and ataxia
- Pale or jaundiced appearance
- Dehydration and weight loss

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical presentation**: The pattern of flight and tail feather loss in young budgerigars is highly suggestive.
- **PCR testing**: Polymerase chain reaction testing for avian polyomavirus DNA from blood, cloacal swabs, or feather samples. This is the gold standard for diagnosis.
- **Viral culture**: Isolation of the virus from affected tissues.
- **Histopathology**: Examination of affected feather follicles and organs reveals characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies.
- **Serology**: Detection of antibodies against APV indicates exposure, though not necessarily active disease.
- **Necropsy**: In fatal cases, liver, spleen, and kidney may show characteristic pathological changes.

## Treatment

There is no specific antiviral treatment for avian polyomavirus:

- **Supportive care**: Nutritional support, hydration, warmth, and stress reduction for symptomatic birds.
- **Secondary infection management**: Antibiotics for any secondary bacterial infections.
- **Feather regrowth**: In some budgerigars with French molt, feathers may regrow at the next molt cycle, though they may be abnormal again.
- **Comfort care**: Providing a safe environment for flightless birds with accessible food, water, and perches at low levels.
- **Quarantine**: Isolate affected and exposed birds from unaffected birds.

## Prevention

- **Vaccination**: An inactivated polyomavirus vaccine is available and recommended for breeding flocks. The vaccine is given to chicks and breeding adults.
- **Testing and quarantine**: Test new birds for APV before introducing them to the flock.
- **Biosecurity**: Maintain strict hygiene in breeding facilities, including disinfection of nursery equipment and hand-feeding tools.
- **Avoid overcrowding**: Reduce stress and disease transmission by maintaining appropriate bird density.
- **Remove carrier birds**: Identify and isolate or remove asymptomatic carriers from breeding flocks.
- **Environmental cleaning**: The virus is resistant in the environment; use appropriate disinfectants (glutaraldehyde, sodium hypochlorite).
- **Do not breed affected birds**: Prevent genetic susceptibility and viral transmission.

## Prognosis

For classic French molt in budgerigars, affected birds often survive and can live normal lifespans, though they may never develop functional flight feathers. Some birds regrow feathers at subsequent molts; others remain permanently affected. For acute polyomavirus in non-budgerigar psittacine chicks, the prognosis is poor, with high mortality rates. Survivors of acute infection may develop chronic feather abnormalities. With vaccination and proper biosecurity, polyomavirus can be effectively controlled in breeding facilities.
