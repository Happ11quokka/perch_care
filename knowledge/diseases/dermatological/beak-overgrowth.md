# Beak Overgrowth

## Overview

Beak overgrowth occurs when the upper beak (rhinotheca), lower beak (gnathotheca), or both grow excessively beyond their normal length and shape. In healthy parrots, the beak is composed of keratin and grows continuously throughout life, similar to fingernails. Normal beak wear from eating, chewing, and preening keeps the beak at a functional length and shape. When the beak grows faster than it wears or when wear is insufficient, overgrowth occurs. An overgrown beak can interfere with eating, preening, and other essential activities. Importantly, beak overgrowth is often a symptom of underlying disease rather than a primary condition.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop beak overgrowth. It is commonly seen in budgerigars (often associated with scaly face mites or liver disease), cockatiels, and older parrots of any species. Macaws, Amazon parrots, and cockatoos may develop overgrowth related to liver disease or PBFD.

## Causes

- **Liver disease (hepatic lipidosis)**: One of the most common underlying causes. The liver plays a role in keratin metabolism, and liver dysfunction often leads to beak overgrowth, flaking, and discoloration.
- **Scaly face mites (Knemidokoptes)**: Burrowing mites that infect the beak and cere, causing crusty, honeycomb-like lesions and abnormal beak growth. Most common in budgerigars.
- **Psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD)**: Circovirus causes progressive beak deformities, overgrowth, and necrosis.
- **Malnutrition**: Vitamin A deficiency, calcium imbalances, and overall poor nutrition affect keratin quality and beak growth.
- **Malocclusion**: Misalignment of the upper and lower beak prevents normal wear.
- **Trauma**: Previous beak injury that altered the growth plate or beak alignment.
- **Tumors**: Neoplasia of the beak or surrounding tissues.
- **Lack of chewing opportunities**: Birds without access to hard foods, wood, or mineral blocks may not wear their beaks adequately.
- **Age-related changes**: Geriatric birds may develop beak overgrowth as activity decreases.

## Symptoms

- Visibly elongated upper or lower beak beyond normal species-typical length
- Beak curving excessively, potentially crossing or growing into the face
- Flaking, peeling, or layering of the beak surface
- Difficulty eating or dropping food
- Weight loss due to inability to eat effectively
- Changes in beak color (darkening, pallor)
- Crusty lesions around the beak and cere (mite infestation)
- Inability to preen properly, leading to poor feather condition
- Cracking or splitting of the beak

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Assessment of beak length, shape, symmetry, and condition.
- **Dietary history**: Evaluation of the diet for nutritional deficiencies.
- **Blood work**: Complete blood chemistry, especially liver enzymes (AST, bile acids, LDH) and protein levels. Calcium and vitamin A assessment.
- **Radiographs**: To evaluate liver size and detect masses or metabolic bone changes.
- **Skin scraping**: To identify *Knemidokoptes* mites (particularly in budgerigars with crusty lesions).
- **PBFD testing**: PCR or DNA probe for circovirus if PBFD is suspected.
- **Biopsy**: If tumor or other growth is suspected on the beak or cere.

## Treatment

- **Beak trimming**: A veterinarian uses a Dremel rotary tool, nail file, or specialized instruments to carefully shape the beak to normal length and contour. This must be done carefully to avoid cutting into the vascular quick, which can cause pain and bleeding. Beak trimming should only be performed by an experienced avian veterinarian.
- **Treat underlying cause**:
  - **Liver disease**: Dietary correction (transition from seed-based to pellet-based diet), milk thistle supplementation, lactulose, and other liver-supportive therapy.
  - **Scaly face mites**: Ivermectin (topical or injectable) is highly effective. Treatment is typically repeated at two-week intervals.
  - **PBFD**: No cure exists; supportive care and management of secondary infections.
  - **Nutritional correction**: Balanced diet, vitamin A supplementation, and calcium correction.
- **Regular maintenance trims**: Birds with chronic beak overgrowth may need periodic trims every 4-8 weeks.
- **Provide chewing opportunities**: Natural wood perches, mineral blocks, cuttlebone, and hard foods to promote natural beak wear.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, nutritionally complete diet (high-quality pellets supplemented with fresh vegetables).
- Provide natural wood branches, mineral blocks, and cuttlebone for beak maintenance.
- Avoid all-seed diets, which are high in fat and contribute to liver disease.
- Schedule annual veterinary wellness exams with blood work to detect liver disease early.
- Treat mite infestations promptly.
- Ensure proper beak alignment in young birds through early veterinary assessment.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the underlying cause. Beak overgrowth from insufficient wear or mild nutritional issues responds well to trimming and husbandry changes, with an excellent prognosis. Overgrowth related to liver disease has a variable prognosis depending on the degree of liver damage. Mite-related overgrowth resolves well with ivermectin treatment. PBFD-related beak problems carry a poor long-term prognosis, as the disease is progressive and incurable. Most birds require ongoing monitoring and periodic beak maintenance.
