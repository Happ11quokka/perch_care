# Self-Mutilation in Parrots

## Overview

Self-mutilation in parrots is a severe behavioral and medical condition in which a bird inflicts damage on its own skin, muscle, and sometimes deeper tissues, going beyond feather destructive behavior (feather plucking) to cause open wounds, bleeding, and tissue destruction. While feather plucking involves pulling or damaging feathers, self-mutilation represents an escalation in which the bird actively chews, tears, or bites into its own flesh. The most commonly targeted areas include the chest (keel area), legs, feet, wing web, and areas under the wings. Self-mutilation is one of the most challenging conditions in avian medicine, often requiring a combined medical and behavioral approach.

## Affected Species

Self-mutilation can occur in any parrot species but is most commonly seen in cockatoos (particularly Moluccan and umbrella cockatoos), African grey parrots, Eclectus parrots, macaws, and conures. Cockatoos are disproportionately represented due to their highly social nature and sensitivity to environmental and emotional stressors.

## Causes

### Medical Causes
- **Skin infections**: Bacterial or fungal dermatitis.
- **Internal disease**: Liver disease, kidney disease, air sacculitis, or reproductive disease causing referred pain.
- **Allergies**: Environmental or food allergies causing skin irritation.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: Lead or zinc poisoning can cause neuropathy and self-directed behavior.
- **Neuropathy**: Nerve damage from avian bornavirus (proventricular dilatation disease) or other neurological conditions.
- **Parasites**: External parasites (rare in indoor birds) or *Giardia* causing skin irritation.
- **Dry skin**: Low humidity environments.
- **Pain**: Any source of chronic pain may trigger self-directed behavior.

### Behavioral/Psychological Causes
- **Boredom and lack of stimulation**: Insufficient environmental enrichment and mental challenges.
- **Social isolation**: Parrots are flock animals and can develop self-destructive behaviors when socially deprived.
- **Stress and anxiety**: Changes in environment, routine, household dynamics, or loss of a companion.
- **Sexual frustration**: Hormonal drives without appropriate outlet.
- **Sleep deprivation**: Insufficient sleep (less than 10-12 hours of darkness).
- **Learned behavior**: Self-mutilation can become habitual and self-reinforcing.

## Symptoms

- Open wounds on the chest, legs, wing web, or other accessible body areas
- Active bleeding from self-inflicted injuries
- Exposed muscle tissue or bone in severe cases
- Missing feathers in the area surrounding wounds
- Constant chewing or biting at the affected area
- Scab formation followed by repeated re-opening of wounds
- Weight loss from chronic stress and energy expenditure
- Lethargy and depression
- Increased vocalization or distress calls

## Diagnosis

- **Thorough physical examination**: Assessment of all wounds and their distribution.
- **Complete blood work**: CBC, chemistry panel, heavy metal levels to rule out medical causes.
- **Radiographs**: To evaluate for internal disease, organ enlargement, or metallic foreign bodies.
- **Skin biopsy**: Histopathology and culture of affected skin to identify infections or inflammatory conditions.
- **Infectious disease testing**: Bornavirus, PBFD, chlamydiosis screening.
- **Behavioral history**: Detailed assessment of the bird's environment, social situation, diet, sleep schedule, and behavioral patterns.
- **Allergy testing**: If allergic dermatitis is suspected.

## Treatment

Treatment requires addressing both medical and behavioral components:

### Medical Treatment
- **Wound care**: Cleaning and treating open wounds. Topical antibiotics or silver sulfadiazine for infected wounds.
- **Elizabethan collar (e-collar)**: A protective collar to prevent the bird from reaching the wound and allow healing. Various designs exist including tube collars and flat collars.
- **Systemic antibiotics**: For secondary wound infections.
- **Anti-inflammatory therapy**: Meloxicam for pain and inflammation.
- **Behavioral medications**: Haloperidol, fluoxetine, or other psychoactive drugs may be prescribed by an avian veterinarian in severe cases.
- **Hormone therapy**: Leuprolide or Deslorelin if hormonal drives contribute.
- **Treatment of underlying medical conditions**: Address any identified medical cause.

### Behavioral/Environmental Treatment
- **Environmental enrichment**: Provide foraging opportunities, destructible toys, puzzle feeders, and rotating novelty items.
- **Social interaction**: Increase quality social time with the owner or consider a compatible companion bird.
- **Sleep schedule**: Ensure 10-12 hours of uninterrupted darkness nightly.
- **Diet improvement**: Transition to a varied, balanced diet.
- **Bathing/misting**: Regular showers or misting to improve skin and feather condition.
- **Full-spectrum lighting**: UVB lighting for overall health.
- **Reduce stressors**: Identify and minimize sources of stress or anxiety.
- **Avian behavioral consultation**: Work with a certified avian behaviorist for chronic cases.

## Prevention

- Provide abundant mental stimulation and environmental enrichment from a young age.
- Maintain consistent social interaction and daily out-of-cage time.
- Establish a regular sleep schedule with adequate darkness.
- Feed a nutritionally complete and varied diet.
- Maintain appropriate humidity (40-60%) in the bird's environment.
- Address feather plucking behavior early before it escalates to self-mutilation.
- Schedule regular veterinary check-ups to detect medical issues early.

## Prognosis

Self-mutilation is one of the most challenging conditions to treat in avian medicine. Prognosis is guarded and depends on the underlying cause, duration of the behavior, and the owner's commitment to long-term management. Cases with an identifiable and treatable medical cause have a better prognosis. Chronic, behavioral self-mutilation may require lifelong management and may never be fully resolved. Many birds can be managed to prevent further tissue damage, but recurrence is common, especially during periods of stress or change. Early intervention offers the best chance for improvement.
