# Vitamin A Deficiency (Hypovitaminosis A)

## Overview

Vitamin A deficiency, or hypovitaminosis A, is the most common nutritional deficiency in pet parrots and is a major underlying factor in many avian health problems. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining healthy epithelial tissues (skin, mucous membranes, respiratory lining, gastrointestinal lining), immune function, vision, and reproductive health. Birds fed primarily seed-based diets are highly susceptible because most seeds (particularly sunflower seeds and millet) are extremely low in vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene. The deficiency leads to squamous metaplasia, a pathological change where normal mucous-secreting epithelial cells are replaced by keratinized squamous cells, making tissues vulnerable to infection.

## Affected Species

All parrot species fed seed-based diets are at risk. Amazon Parrots, African Grey Parrots, cockatiels, budgerigars, and cockatoos are frequently affected due to their popularity as pets and the historically common practice of feeding primarily seed-based diets. Species that are particularly selective eaters or "seed junkies" are at highest risk.

## Causes

The primary cause is a diet deficient in vitamin A and beta-carotene, most commonly an all-seed or predominantly seed-based diet. Sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, and millet contain negligible amounts of vitamin A. Other contributing factors include poor diet variety, refusal of vitamin A-rich foods (dark leafy greens, orange and red vegetables, sweet potato), and chronic illness affecting nutrient absorption. Beta-carotene is the primary dietary precursor of vitamin A in birds and is converted to active vitamin A in the body.

## Symptoms

- White plaques or abscesses in the mouth, choana (slit in the roof of the mouth), and sinuses
- Blunting or absence of choanal papillae (the normal finger-like projections lining the choana)
- Nasal discharge and sneezing
- Swollen, infected infraorbital sinuses
- Respiratory infections (secondary to compromised mucosal barriers)
- Poor feather quality and color
- Thickened, flaky skin on the feet (pododermatitis/bumblefoot)
- Reproductive problems (infertility, egg binding)
- Kidney disease (renal gout due to urate accumulation)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, dietary history, and response to supplementation. Physical examination revealing choanal papillae blunting, oral plaques, and sinus infections in a bird fed a seed-based diet is strongly suggestive. Blood testing may show elevated white blood cells due to secondary infections. Plasma vitamin A levels can be measured but are not widely available and do not always reflect tissue stores. Biopsy of affected tissues shows characteristic squamous metaplasia. Response to dietary correction and vitamin A supplementation helps confirm the diagnosis retrospectively.

## Treatment

Correction of the underlying dietary deficiency is the most important step. Injectable vitamin A (retinol palmitate) can be administered by a veterinarian for acute, severe deficiency. Oral vitamin A supplementation is used for milder cases. Caution must be exercised with supplementation, as vitamin A is fat-soluble and excessive doses can cause toxicity (hypervitaminosis A). The diet should be transitioned to include vitamin A-rich foods such as sweet potato, carrots, dark leafy greens (kale, spinach, broccoli), red peppers, and formulated pelleted diets. Secondary infections require appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced diet including formulated pellets as the base
- Offer vitamin A-rich vegetables and fruits daily (sweet potato, carrots, dark leafy greens, red bell peppers)
- Limit seed intake to a small portion of the overall diet
- Avoid all-seed diets
- Regular veterinary health examinations including oral and choanal inspection
- Gradual diet conversion from seeds to pellets and fresh foods

## Prognosis

The prognosis is good if the deficiency is identified early and dietary changes are implemented. Epithelial changes can reverse with adequate vitamin A intake, and choanal papillae may regenerate. Secondary infections respond to treatment once the underlying deficiency is corrected. Advanced cases with chronic organ damage (particularly kidney disease) carry a more guarded prognosis. Long-term dietary management is essential to prevent recurrence.
