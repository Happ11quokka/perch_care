# Lead Poisoning (Plumbism)

## Overview

Lead poisoning, or plumbism, is one of the most common and serious heavy metal toxicoses in pet parrots, considered a medical emergency requiring immediate veterinary intervention. Lead is a highly toxic heavy metal that affects virtually every organ system in the body, with the gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, kidneys, and blood-forming organs being most severely impacted. Parrots are particularly vulnerable due to their natural curiosity and tendency to chew and ingest non-food items. Even small amounts of lead can cause severe clinical disease and death. Lead toxicity has been recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in companion birds for decades.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to lead poisoning. Species that are particularly vigorous chewers, including macaws, cockatoos, African Grey Parrots, Amazon Parrots, and conures, are at elevated risk. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, and lovebirds can be fatally affected by ingesting very small quantities of lead. Free-roaming birds with access to household items containing lead are at greatest risk.

## Causes

Lead poisoning occurs from ingestion of lead-containing materials. Common sources in the household include old paint (houses built before 1978 may contain lead paint), stained glass windows and their solder, fishing sinkers, curtain weights, lead foil from wine bottles, lead solder on electronics, costume jewelry, some metallic toys, leaded glass ornaments, glazed ceramics with lead-based glazes, linoleum flooring, batteries, ammunition pellets, and antique furniture hardware. Some imported bird toys and cage accessories may contain lead. Birds may ingest lead particles by chewing on contaminated windowsills, door frames, or walls with peeling paint.

## Symptoms

Neurological signs:
- Seizures (most alarming presentation)
- Head tilt, circling
- Ataxia (uncoordinated movement, stumbling)
- Blindness
- Tremors and muscle weakness
- Leg paralysis

Gastrointestinal signs:
- Regurgitation and vomiting
- Bloody or dark droppings (melena)
- Diarrhea
- Anorexia and weight loss

General signs:
- Lethargy, depression
- Polyuria and polydipsia (increased urine output and thirst)
- Wing droop
- Sudden death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical suspicion, history, and laboratory testing. Blood lead levels are the most important diagnostic test, with levels above 0.2 ppm (20 mcg/dL) considered elevated and levels above 0.5 ppm (50 mcg/dL) considered diagnostic for lead toxicosis. Radiography is critical to identify metallic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract (lead particles appear as bright white densities). Complete blood count may reveal anemia with basophilic stippling of red blood cells (a classic finding in lead toxicity). Blood chemistry may show elevated liver and kidney values. Neurological examination may reveal cranial nerve deficits.

## Treatment

Lead poisoning is an emergency requiring immediate treatment. Chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA (CaEDTA) is the standard treatment, administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection for 5 days, followed by reassessment. DMSA (succimer) is an oral chelating agent that can be used as an alternative or follow-up to CaEDTA. If metallic foreign bodies are identified on radiographs, their removal is essential via gavage, endoscopy, or surgery, as continued lead absorption from retained fragments will make chelation ineffective. Seizure control with midazolam or diazepam may be necessary. Supportive care including fluid therapy (to support renal excretion), nutritional support, anti-nausea medication, and a warm, dark, quiet environment is critical. Multiple courses of chelation may be required.

## Prevention

- Bird-proof the home thoroughly before allowing unsupervised out-of-cage time
- Test paint in older homes for lead content
- Remove all accessible lead-containing items from the bird's environment
- Do not allow birds to chew on window frames, door frames, or walls, especially in older buildings
- Use only bird-safe toys and cage accessories from reputable manufacturers
- Remove curtain weights, fishing sinkers, and other small lead items
- Store craft supplies, jewelry-making materials, and solder out of reach
- Be aware that some imported products may contain undisclosed lead

## Prognosis

The prognosis depends on the amount of lead ingested, duration of exposure, severity of clinical signs, and promptness of treatment. Birds treated early before severe neurological involvement have a fair to good prognosis. Severe neurological signs (seizures, blindness, paralysis) carry a guarded prognosis, as some neurological damage may be permanent. Prompt chelation therapy and removal of the lead source are critical for survival. Some birds recover fully, while others may have lasting neurological deficits. Without treatment, lead poisoning is frequently fatal.
