# Iodine Deficiency (Goiter)

## Overview

Iodine deficiency in parrots leads to thyroid gland enlargement, a condition known as goiter or thyroid hyperplasia. Iodine is an essential trace mineral required for the production of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), which regulate metabolism, growth, feather development, and reproductive function. When dietary iodine is insufficient, the thyroid gland enlarges in an attempt to compensate for reduced hormone production. In severe cases, the enlarged thyroid glands can compress the trachea, esophagus, and crop, causing breathing difficulties and regurgitation. This condition is most closely associated with budgerigars fed exclusively seed-based diets.

## Affected Species

Budgerigars (parakeets) are by far the most commonly affected species, as they are frequently maintained on seed-only diets that are deficient in iodine. Cockatiels and other small parrots on seed-based diets can also be affected. Larger parrot species are less commonly diagnosed with iodine deficiency goiter, though they can develop thyroid dysfunction when fed nutritionally inadequate diets. The condition was historically very common in budgerigars before the widespread availability of iodine-supplemented mineral blocks and formulated diets.

## Causes

The primary cause is a diet deficient in iodine, most commonly an all-seed diet. Seeds are naturally very low in iodine content. Goitrogenic substances found in some foods (such as broccoli, cabbage, kale, and soy) can interfere with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, though this is rarely a significant factor in pet birds. Lack of iodine-supplemented mineral blocks or cuttlebones, absence of formulated pellets in the diet, and feeding only one type of seed all contribute to the risk.

## Symptoms

- Regurgitation or vomiting (due to esophageal or crop compression)
- Difficulty swallowing
- Labored breathing, wheezing (due to tracheal compression by enlarged thyroid)
- Voice change or squeaking sounds during breathing
- Crop distension and slow emptying
- Lethargy and weakness
- Weight loss
- Poor feather condition and delayed molting
- In severe cases, visible swelling in the neck/throat area
- Sudden death due to tracheal obstruction (in extreme cases)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on clinical signs, dietary history, and response to iodine supplementation. In budgerigars, the combination of regurgitation, respiratory difficulty, and a seed-only diet is highly suggestive. Physical examination may reveal a palpable mass in the thoracic inlet region, though the thyroid glands in budgerigars are located deep in the thoracic inlet and may not be easily palpated. Radiography may show a soft tissue mass displacing the trachea or crop. Thyroid hormone levels (T4) may be low but testing is not always available for avian species. Response to iodine supplementation is often used as a diagnostic and therapeutic trial.

## Treatment

Iodine supplementation is the primary treatment. Lugol's iodine solution can be added to drinking water under veterinary guidance. Sodium iodide administered orally or by injection may be used in acute cases. Iodine-containing mineral blocks or cuttlebones should be provided. Dietary correction to include iodine-containing formulated pellets is essential for long-term management. In birds with severe tracheal compression, supportive care including oxygen supplementation and anti-inflammatory medications may be needed until the thyroid gland size decreases. Most birds show improvement within days to weeks of iodine supplementation.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced diet that includes formulated pellets containing iodine
- Provide an iodine-supplemented mineral block or cuttlebone
- Avoid exclusive seed diets
- Offer a variety of fresh vegetables and foods
- Regular veterinary examinations
- Educate bird owners about the dangers of all-seed diets for budgerigars

## Prognosis

The prognosis for iodine deficiency goiter is generally excellent when diagnosed and treated early. Most birds respond rapidly to iodine supplementation, with thyroid gland size decreasing and clinical signs resolving within days to weeks. Severe, longstanding cases with significant tracheal compression may take longer to resolve and carry some risk of acute respiratory obstruction. Long-term dietary correction prevents recurrence. Birds transitioned to balanced diets rarely develop goiter again.
