# Iron Storage Disease (Hemochromatosis)

## Overview

Iron storage disease, also known as hemochromatosis, is a condition characterized by excessive accumulation of iron in the tissues, particularly the liver, leading to progressive organ damage and failure. The disease occurs when dietary iron absorption exceeds the body's ability to excrete it, resulting in iron deposition in hepatocytes and other cells. In birds, iron storage disease is primarily a concern in certain softbill species, but it can also affect some parrot species, particularly lories and lorikeets. The condition is typically chronic and progressive, and by the time clinical signs become apparent, significant liver damage has already occurred.

## Affected Species

Toucans, toucanets, aracaris, mynahs (Hill Mynahs in particular), starlings, and birds of paradise are the species most commonly and severely affected. Among parrots, lories and lorikeets are considered susceptible due to their nectar-based diet and unique digestive physiology. Eclectus Parrots have also been reported with iron storage disease. These species appear to have evolved on low-iron diets in their natural environments and are therefore unable to regulate iron absorption effectively when fed commercially available diets containing higher iron levels.

## Causes

The primary cause is dietary iron excess relative to the species' physiological capacity to regulate iron absorption. Many commercial bird foods, fruits (especially citrus), and supplements contain iron levels that are too high for susceptible species. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) enhances iron absorption and can worsen the condition when fed in conjunction with iron-containing foods. Citrus fruits are particularly problematic because they are both high in iron and high in vitamin C. The underlying mechanism involves unregulated iron uptake from the intestinal tract, as susceptible species lack the ability to downregulate iron absorption when body stores are adequate.

## Symptoms

- Lethargy and depression
- Difficulty breathing (ascites causing abdominal distension)
- Abdominal swelling (due to hepatomegaly or ascites)
- Weight loss
- Fluffed feathers
- Sudden death (in acute liver failure)
- Dark or greenish droppings
- Weakness and exercise intolerance
- In advanced cases, signs of liver failure including jaundice

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis requires a combination of clinical suspicion based on species and diet history, blood work, and imaging. Elevated serum iron levels and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) can be measured. Liver biopsy with Prussian blue staining is the definitive diagnostic tool, revealing hemosiderin deposits in hepatocytes. Blood chemistry may show elevated liver enzymes (AST, bile acids). Radiography or ultrasound may reveal hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen). Post-mortem examination shows a darkened, enlarged liver with heavy iron deposition.

## Treatment

There is no cure for iron storage disease, and treatment focuses on slowing progression and managing symptoms. Dietary modification to a strictly low-iron diet is the most important intervention. Phlebotomy (therapeutic blood removal) can reduce body iron stores and is performed under veterinary supervision in a series of sessions. Deferoxamine (an iron chelation agent) can be administered to bind excess iron for excretion, though its use in birds is limited and requires careful monitoring. Ascites may require drainage. Liver-supportive therapy including milk thistle (silymarin) may be beneficial. Vitamin C and citrus fruits must be strictly eliminated from the diet.

## Prevention

- Feed susceptible species a low-iron diet (less than 100 ppm iron content)
- Avoid citrus fruits and other high-vitamin C foods that enhance iron absorption
- Use specialized commercial diets formulated for iron-sensitive species
- Avoid iron-fortified foods, supplements, and treats
- Do not provide iron-containing mineral blocks
- Feed low-iron fruits such as bananas, papaya, and grapes instead of citrus
- Regular veterinary monitoring of iron levels in susceptible species

## Prognosis

The prognosis for iron storage disease is guarded to poor, depending on the stage at diagnosis. Early detection with mild liver involvement may allow management through dietary modification and phlebotomy, providing a reasonable quality of life. Advanced disease with severe liver fibrosis, hepatomegaly, or ascites carries a poor prognosis. Lifelong dietary management is essential. With diligent low-iron diet management, some birds can live for years after diagnosis.
