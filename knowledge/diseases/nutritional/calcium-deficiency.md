# Calcium Deficiency (Hypocalcemia)

## Overview

Calcium deficiency, or hypocalcemia, is a significant and potentially life-threatening nutritional disorder in pet parrots. Calcium is essential for bone formation, muscle function (including cardiac muscle), nerve transmission, blood clotting, and eggshell production. When blood calcium levels fall below the normal range, birds can develop seizures, tremors, and metabolic bone disease. The condition is closely interrelated with vitamin D3 status, as vitamin D3 is required for intestinal calcium absorption. Without adequate vitamin D3 and exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light, even birds consuming adequate dietary calcium may become deficient.

## Affected Species

African Grey Parrots are the most notoriously susceptible species, frequently presenting with hypocalcemic seizures. This species appears to have unique calcium metabolism requirements that make them particularly vulnerable. Other commonly affected species include cockatiels, Amazon Parrots, Eclectus Parrots, and macaws. Egg-laying females of any species are at elevated risk due to the calcium demands of eggshell formation. Young, growing birds also have high calcium requirements.

## Causes

The primary causes of calcium deficiency include inadequate dietary calcium intake (seed-based diets are extremely low in calcium), vitamin D3 deficiency (which impairs calcium absorption), lack of exposure to UVB light (needed for vitamin D3 synthesis in the skin), and excessive dietary phosphorus (which interferes with calcium absorption). Seeds have a very unfavorable calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. Chronic egg-laying drains calcium reserves rapidly. Parathyroid gland dysfunction and renal disease can also contribute to abnormal calcium metabolism.

## Symptoms

- Seizures and tremors (most dramatic presentation, common in African Greys)
- Muscle weakness and incoordination
- Falling from perch
- Inability to grip the perch
- Metabolic bone disease (soft, deformed bones in young birds)
- Egg binding in females (inability to pass eggs)
- Thin-shelled or soft-shelled eggs
- Pathological fractures (bones breaking under normal activity)
- Beak deformities in chronic cases
- Lethargy and depression

## Diagnosis

Blood calcium levels (total and ionized calcium) are measured to confirm hypocalcemia. Normal total calcium levels in parrots are approximately 8-12 mg/dL, depending on the species. Ionized calcium is a more accurate indicator of functional calcium status. Radiography may reveal decreased bone density, pathological fractures, or medullary bone changes. Blood phosphorus levels and the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio should be evaluated. Vitamin D3 levels can be assessed but are not widely available. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels may be elevated in response to low calcium.

## Treatment

Acute hypocalcemic seizures are an emergency requiring immediate intravenous or intramuscular calcium gluconate administration. Oral calcium supplementation is used for chronic or mild deficiency. Vitamin D3 supplementation is essential, as calcium cannot be absorbed effectively without it. Exposure to full-spectrum UVB lighting (specifically UVB wavelengths around 290-315 nm) for several hours daily promotes natural vitamin D3 synthesis. Dietary correction to include calcium-rich foods (broccoli, kale, almonds, cooked egg with shell) and formulated pellets is critical. Egg-laying females may require additional calcium support.

## Prevention

- Provide a balanced, pelleted diet as the dietary base
- Offer calcium-rich foods regularly (dark leafy greens, broccoli, almonds)
- Ensure adequate vitamin D3 through diet or supplementation
- Provide access to full-spectrum UVB lighting for indoor birds
- Maintain an appropriate calcium-to-phosphorus dietary ratio (approximately 2:1)
- Discourage chronic egg-laying through environmental management
- Regular veterinary blood work, especially for African Grey Parrots

## Prognosis

The prognosis for hypocalcemia depends on the severity and chronicity of the condition. Acute hypocalcemic seizures respond well to emergency calcium supplementation, and most birds recover fully if treated promptly. Chronic metabolic bone disease in young birds may result in permanent skeletal deformities. Long-term dietary management and UVB light provision are essential to prevent recurrence. African Grey Parrots require lifelong attention to calcium and vitamin D3 status.
