# Zinc Toxicity (Zinc Poisoning)

## Overview

Zinc toxicity, or zinc poisoning, is a common and potentially fatal heavy metal toxicosis in pet parrots caused by ingestion of zinc-containing materials. Parrots are naturally curious and use their beaks to explore and chew their environment, making them highly susceptible to ingesting metallic objects and cage hardware. Zinc is found in galvanized wire and metal (commonly used in cages, aviaries, and hardware cloth), certain toys, zippers, coins, padlocks, and other household items. Once ingested, zinc is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and can cause damage to multiple organ systems, including the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. Zinc toxicity is also known as "new wire disease" because it commonly occurs when birds are placed in new galvanized wire cages.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to zinc toxicity. Birds that are vigorous chewers are at greatest risk, including cockatoos, macaws, African Grey Parrots, Amazon Parrots, and conures. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, and lovebirds can also be affected, particularly by smaller zinc-containing items. Young birds exploring their environment and birds housed in galvanized wire cages are at elevated risk.

## Causes

Zinc toxicity occurs from ingestion of zinc-containing materials. Common sources include galvanized cage wire (wire coated with zinc to prevent rust), galvanized hardware cloth, zinc-plated clips, chains, quick-links, padlocks, staples, nails, coins (pennies minted after 1982 contain a zinc core), zippers, snaps, costume jewelry, and some painted toys containing zinc-based paints. Chewing on galvanized wire is the single most common source. New galvanized wire is particularly dangerous because it has more surface zinc available for ingestion. Even powder-coated wire can contain zinc underneath that becomes accessible when the coating is chewed off.

## Symptoms

- Anorexia (loss of appetite) and weight loss
- Lethargy and depression
- Regurgitation and vomiting
- Diarrhea, often with dark or bloody droppings
- Increased thirst and urination (polyuria/polydipsia)
- Weakness and inability to perch
- Feather plucking or self-mutilation
- Ataxia (uncoordinated movement)
- Seizures in severe cases
- Renal failure signs (excessive urates in droppings)
- Pancreatic damage (secondary diabetes-like signs)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on history of potential zinc exposure, clinical signs, and laboratory testing. Blood zinc levels (measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry or ICP-MS) above the normal range confirm elevated zinc. Normal blood zinc levels in parrots are approximately 0.7-2.0 ppm (mcg/mL), with toxicity generally occurring above 2.0 ppm. Radiography is important to identify any metallic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract that serve as a continuing source of zinc absorption. Complete blood count may show anemia and heterophilia. Blood chemistry may reveal elevated kidney values (uric acid), liver enzymes, and pancreatic enzymes.

## Treatment

If metallic foreign bodies are identified on radiographs, their removal is the first priority. Gavage (flushing the proventriculus and ventriculus), endoscopic retrieval, or surgical removal may be necessary depending on the location and size of the metallic objects. Chelation therapy with calcium disodium EDTA (CaEDTA) is the primary medical treatment, administered by injection to bind circulating zinc and promote its excretion through the kidneys. Chelation is typically administered for 5 days, followed by reassessment. D-penicillamine can be used as an oral chelation agent for less severe cases or as follow-up therapy. Supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support, and anti-nausea medication is essential.

## Prevention

- Use only stainless steel or powder-coated (zinc-free) cage materials
- Inspect and remove any galvanized wire, clips, or hardware from cages
- If galvanized wire must be used, scrub it with vinegar or a wire brush and rinse thoroughly before use
- Remove quick-links, padlocks, and other zinc-containing hardware from cages
- Bird-proof the home by removing accessible zinc-containing items
- Avoid giving birds access to coins, zippers, keys, and costume jewelry
- Use only bird-safe toys from reputable manufacturers

## Prognosis

The prognosis depends on the amount of zinc ingested, duration of exposure, and promptness of treatment. Mild to moderate zinc toxicity diagnosed and treated early carries a good prognosis, with most birds recovering fully after chelation therapy and removal of the zinc source. Severe toxicity with significant renal damage, pancreatic injury, or prolonged exposure carries a more guarded prognosis. Permanent kidney or pancreatic damage can occur. Removal of the zinc source is essential for recovery, and ongoing exposure will cause treatment failure.
