# Fatty Liver Disease (Hepatic Lipidosis)

## Overview

Fatty liver disease, or hepatic lipidosis, is a common and potentially fatal metabolic liver disorder in pet parrots caused by excessive fat accumulation in liver cells (hepatocytes). When a bird consumes a high-fat diet and leads a sedentary lifestyle, the liver becomes overwhelmed with fat metabolism, and lipid droplets accumulate within hepatocytes. Over time, this fat infiltration damages liver cells, impairs liver function, and can progress to liver failure. Hepatic lipidosis is strongly associated with seed-based diets, as many seeds (particularly sunflower seeds and safflower seeds) are very high in fat. The condition often develops insidiously over months to years.

## Affected Species

Amazon Parrots are the most commonly affected species, owing to their tendency toward obesity and their popularity as pets often fed high-fat seed diets. Cockatoos, budgerigars, cockatiels, Rose-breasted Cockatoos (Galahs), and Quaker Parrots are also frequently affected. Any parrot species maintained on a high-fat diet with limited exercise can develop fatty liver disease. Species that are naturally active in the wild but confined to small cages with limited flight opportunities are at particular risk.

## Causes

The primary cause is a high-fat diet, most commonly seed-based diets rich in sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, peanuts, and other high-fat seeds and nuts. Contributing factors include obesity, sedentary lifestyle (limited flight and exercise), excessive caloric intake, and genetic predisposition in certain species. Hormonal influences, particularly in female birds with chronic egg-laying, can also contribute. Some toxins and certain medications may accelerate hepatic fat accumulation. Lack of lipotropic nutrients (choline, methionine) in the diet can impair normal fat processing by the liver.

## Symptoms

- Obesity (visible subcutaneous fat deposits, especially over the abdomen and chest)
- Overgrown, flaky, or soft beak
- Overgrown toenails
- Poor feather quality
- Lethargy and reduced activity
- Labored breathing (due to fat deposits in the coelom compressing air sacs)
- Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver, sometimes visible as a bulge below the keel)
- Yellow or green urates (indicating liver dysfunction)
- Decreased appetite in advanced stages
- Sudden death from liver hemorrhage

## Diagnosis

Blood chemistry reveals elevated liver enzymes (AST, LDH), elevated bile acids, elevated triglycerides and cholesterol. Plasma protein electrophoresis may show changes consistent with liver disease. Radiography typically shows hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) and may reveal coelomic fat deposits. Ultrasound can visualize liver changes and fatty infiltration. Liver biopsy provides definitive diagnosis, showing fat-laden hepatocytes (lipid vacuoles within liver cells). The biopsy also assesses the degree of fibrosis and irreversible damage. Physical examination often reveals an obese bird with palpable subcutaneous fat.

## Treatment

Dietary modification is the cornerstone of treatment. The diet must be gradually transitioned from high-fat seeds to a balanced formulated pellet diet supplemented with fresh vegetables and limited fruits. Weight loss should be gradual and monitored, as rapid weight loss can paradoxically worsen hepatic lipidosis. Lactulose may be prescribed to reduce hepatic toxin absorption. Milk thistle (silymarin) is commonly used as a hepatoprotective supplement. Choline and methionine supplementation supports hepatic fat metabolism. Increased exercise through flight time, foraging opportunities, and environmental enrichment is essential. Fluid therapy and supportive care are needed for severely affected birds.

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, low-fat pelleted diet as the dietary base
- Limit high-fat seeds and nuts to occasional treats only
- Encourage regular exercise through flight time and foraging enrichment
- Monitor body weight regularly
- Avoid overfeeding and excessive treat-giving
- Provide appropriately sized cages that allow movement and wing-flapping
- Regular veterinary health checks including blood work

## Prognosis

The prognosis depends on the stage of disease at diagnosis. Early hepatic lipidosis with mild fat infiltration can be reversed with dietary and lifestyle changes, carrying a good prognosis. Moderate disease responds to treatment but requires dedicated long-term management. Advanced disease with significant liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hemorrhage carries a guarded to poor prognosis. Sudden death from liver hemorrhage can occur in birds with severely fatty, enlarged livers. Lifelong dietary management is necessary.
