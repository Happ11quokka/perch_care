# Heavy Metal Poisoning in Parrots

## Overview

Heavy metal poisoning is one of the most common toxicological emergencies in pet parrots. Lead and zinc are the two metals most frequently responsible, though copper and iron toxicosis can also occur. Parrots are particularly vulnerable because of their natural curiosity and tendency to explore objects with their beaks, leading to ingestion of metallic particles or fragments. Heavy metal poisoning affects multiple organ systems including the gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, kidneys, and blood. Without prompt treatment, heavy metal toxicosis can be fatal.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible. Larger parrots such as macaws, cockatoos, and Amazon Parrots are frequently affected because their powerful beaks can break apart metal objects. African Grey Parrots, conures, and Eclectus Parrots are also commonly presented. Smaller species like budgerigars and cockatiels may ingest smaller amounts but can develop severe toxicosis more rapidly due to lower body mass.

## Causes

**Lead sources:**
- Old paint and paint chips (pre-1978 buildings)
- Stained glass, leaded glass, and solder
- Fishing weights and sinkers
- Curtain weights and drapery weights
- Lead-containing ceramics and glazes
- Ammunition and pellets
- Some costume jewelry and antique items

**Zinc sources:**
- Galvanized wire, cages, and cage hardware
- Pennies minted after 1982 (97.5% zinc)
- Zinc-coated bolts, screws, and fasteners
- Galvanized feeding dishes
- Certain padlocks, quick-links, and snaps
- Board game pieces and monopoly tokens

## Symptoms

**Gastrointestinal signs:**
- Regurgitation and vomiting
- Crop stasis (delayed crop emptying)
- Dark or bloody droppings (melena)
- Decreased appetite or anorexia
- Weight loss

**Neurological signs:**
- Seizures
- Tremors, particularly of the head
- Ataxia and loss of coordination
- Blindness
- Head tilt and circling
- Depression and lethargy

**Other signs:**
- Polyuria and polydipsia (increased urination and thirst)
- Hemoglobinuria (red-brown urine)
- Weakness and leg paralysis
- Feather picking

## Diagnosis

- **Radiographs**: Whole-body radiographs are essential to identify metallic foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract, which appear as bright radio-dense particles or objects
- **Blood metal levels**: Lead levels above 20 mcg/dL indicate toxicity (above 50 mcg/dL is severe); zinc levels above 200 mcg/dL indicate toxicosis
- **Complete blood count**: May show regenerative anemia, basophilic stippling of red blood cells (lead), or heterophilia
- **Blood chemistry panel**: Evaluates kidney and liver function for secondary organ damage
- **Uric acid levels**: Elevated levels suggest renal compromise

## Treatment

- **Chelation therapy**: CaEDTA (calcium disodium EDTA) administered by intramuscular injection is the primary chelating agent; treatment courses typically last 3-5 days with monitoring periods between courses
- **DMSA (succimer)**: Oral chelating agent used as follow-up therapy or when injections are difficult
- **D-penicillamine**: Alternative oral chelator occasionally used
- **Foreign body removal**: Endoscopic or surgical removal of metallic objects from the GI tract; bulk-forming laxatives (psyllium, peanut butter) may aid passage of small fragments
- **Seizure control**: Diazepam for active seizures
- **Supportive care**: IV or subcutaneous fluids, nutritional support via gavage feeding, anti-nausea medications, and warmth
- **Serial monitoring**: Repeat radiographs and blood metal levels to confirm declining levels and clearance

## Prevention

- Use only stainless steel cages and hardware
- Avoid galvanized wire, mesh, or cage components
- Remove all lead-containing objects from the bird's accessible environment
- Inspect toys, cage clips, and accessories for zinc coatings
- Do not use pennies or small metal objects as toys
- Store fishing tackle, ammunition, and craft supplies out of reach
- Regularly audit the bird's environment for potential metal hazards
- Choose powder-coated or stainless steel food and water dishes

## Prognosis

Prognosis is good to excellent when heavy metal poisoning is diagnosed early and treated promptly with chelation therapy. Most birds show clinical improvement within 24-48 hours of starting treatment. Prognosis worsens with prolonged exposure, high blood metal levels, significant organ damage, or persistent metal foreign bodies that cannot be removed. Neurological damage from severe or chronic exposure may be permanent. Fatal outcomes are possible if treatment is delayed.
