# Household Plant Toxicity in Parrots

## Overview

Many common household and garden plants are toxic to parrots and can cause a range of clinical signs from mild gastrointestinal irritation to fatal cardiac arrest. Parrots are naturally curious and enjoy chewing on vegetation, making them particularly vulnerable to plant poisoning when allowed access to toxic species. Because parrots may ingest plant material during unsupervised out-of-cage time or when plants are placed near their cages, owners must be knowledgeable about which plants pose a danger. Prevention through plant identification and removal is the most effective strategy.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to plant toxicity. Free-flighted birds and those allowed extensive out-of-cage time are at greatest risk due to increased access to household plants. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets may be more severely affected by smaller quantities of toxic plant material due to their lower body weight. Larger parrots may consume greater quantities before being noticed.

## Causes

**Commonly toxic household plants include:**

- **Philodendron**: Contains calcium oxalate crystals causing oral and GI irritation
- **Dieffenbachia (Dumb Cane)**: Calcium oxalate crystals causing severe oral pain and swelling
- **Lilies (various species)**: Multiple toxins causing GI, cardiac, and renal effects
- **Oleander**: Cardiac glycosides causing fatal arrhythmias
- **Foxglove (Digitalis)**: Cardiac glycosides similar to oleander
- **Poinsettia**: Mild GI irritation from sap
- **Rhododendron and azalea**: Grayanotoxins causing GI, cardiovascular, and neurological signs
- **Ivy (Hedera species)**: Saponins causing GI irritation and contact dermatitis
- **Daffodil and narcissus**: Lycorine alkaloids causing vomiting and diarrhea
- **Amaryllis**: Alkaloids causing GI signs and tremors
- **Yew (Taxus)**: Taxine alkaloids causing sudden cardiac death
- **Mistletoe**: Lectins and phoratoxins causing GI and cardiovascular effects
- **Sago palm**: Cycasin causing liver failure

## Symptoms

Symptoms vary depending on the plant species and the toxin involved:

- **GI signs**: Regurgitation, vomiting, diarrhea, crop stasis, oral irritation and swelling (especially calcium oxalate plants)
- **Cardiac signs**: Arrhythmias, bradycardia or tachycardia, sudden cardiac arrest (oleander, foxglove, yew)
- **Neurological signs**: Tremors, seizures, ataxia, weakness
- **Respiratory signs**: Dyspnea, oral swelling obstructing airway
- **Dermatological signs**: Contact irritation, redness around beak and mouth
- **General signs**: Lethargy, depression, appetite loss, excessive salivation
- **Severe cases**: Organ failure and death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on witnessed or suspected plant ingestion combined with compatible clinical signs. Identification of the specific plant is crucial for determining the expected toxin and prognosis. Physical examination may reveal oral lesions from calcium oxalate plants, cardiac abnormalities from glycoside-containing plants, or neurological deficits. Blood chemistry panel and complete blood count assess organ function. Electrocardiography is essential when cardiac glycoside ingestion is suspected. Crop contents may contain identifiable plant fragments.

## Treatment

Treatment depends on the specific plant and toxin involved:

- **Crop lavage**: Removal of plant material from the crop if ingestion is recent
- **Activated charcoal**: To reduce further absorption of toxins
- **Fluid therapy**: Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids for hydration and toxin dilution
- **Pain management**: For oral irritation from oxalate crystal plants
- **Cardiac monitoring and treatment**: Anti-arrhythmic medications for cardiac glycoside ingestion
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: To reduce tissue swelling and inflammation
- **Seizure control**: Diazepam for neurological signs
- **Hepatoprotective care**: Supportive liver treatment for hepatotoxic plants
- **Supportive care**: Warmth, nutritional support, and stress reduction

## Prevention

- Identify all plants in the home and garden; remove any that are toxic to birds
- Use only verified bird-safe plants in areas accessible to parrots
- Consult comprehensive toxic plant lists from avian veterinary resources
- Never assume a plant is safe without verification
- Keep birds supervised during out-of-cage time
- Place bird-safe barriers around plants that cannot be removed
- Educate household members about plant dangers to birds
- Consider artificial plants as a safe alternative in bird-accessible areas
- Be cautious with floral arrangements and gift plants

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies dramatically depending on the plant species involved. Mild irritants like philodendron typically resolve with supportive care and carry a good prognosis. Cardiac glycoside-containing plants (oleander, foxglove, yew) carry a poor to grave prognosis due to the risk of fatal arrhythmias. Hepatotoxic plants like sago palm can cause fatal liver failure. Early identification of the plant, prompt veterinary care, and appropriate supportive treatment improve outcomes for most plant toxicities.
