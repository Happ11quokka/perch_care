# Avocado Toxicity in Parrots

## Overview

Avocado toxicity is a serious and often fatal poisoning in parrots caused by persin, a fungicidal toxin found in all parts of the avocado plant (Persea americana). Persin is present in the fruit flesh, skin, pit, leaves, bark, and stems of the avocado. It acts primarily as a cardiac toxin in birds, causing myocardial necrosis (death of heart muscle cells) and resulting in acute heart failure. There is no antidote for persin toxicity, and death can occur within 12 to 48 hours of ingestion, making complete avoidance the only effective prevention strategy.

## Affected Species

All bird species are considered susceptible to avocado toxicity, with parrots being highly sensitive. Budgerigars, cockatiels, canaries, and smaller psittacines may succumb more rapidly due to their lower body mass. Larger parrots including Amazon Parrots, macaws, cockatoos, and African Grey Parrots are also at serious risk. No parrot species should be considered safe from avocado toxicity. Some individual variation in sensitivity exists, but no reliable tolerance threshold has been established.

## Causes

- **Ingestion of avocado flesh**: Even small amounts of the fruit can be toxic
- **Avocado skin and pit**: Contain higher concentrations of persin
- **Avocado leaves and bark**: Toxic if chewed or ingested
- **Guacamole and avocado-containing foods**: Any prepared food containing avocado
- **Cross-contamination**: Cutting boards, knives, or hands contaminated with avocado residue
- **Avocado plants**: Birds chewing on leaves or branches of potted avocado plants

## Symptoms

Symptoms can appear within hours of ingestion and progress rapidly:

- Respiratory distress: increased respiratory rate, open-mouth breathing, tail bobbing
- Lethargy and weakness
- Fluffed feathers and sitting on cage floor
- Subcutaneous edema (swelling under the skin), particularly around the neck and chest
- Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of skin and mucous membranes)
- Cardiac arrhythmias and increased heart rate
- Restlessness followed by collapse
- Sudden death, sometimes without prior observable symptoms
- Decreased appetite (if time allows before acute decline)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily based on known or suspected exposure to avocado combined with compatible clinical signs. There is no specific blood test for persin. Physical examination may reveal tachycardia, arrhythmias, respiratory distress, and subcutaneous edema. Radiographs may show pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion. Post-mortem examination typically reveals hydropericardium (fluid around the heart), pulmonary edema, hepatic congestion, and myocardial necrosis. A thorough history regarding the bird's access to avocado is the most important diagnostic tool.

## Treatment

There is **no specific antidote** for avocado poisoning. Treatment is entirely supportive and symptomatic:

- **Activated charcoal**: May reduce absorption if administered very soon after ingestion
- **Fluid therapy**: Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids to support circulation
- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen for respiratory distress
- **Cardiac support**: Treatment of arrhythmias as they arise
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: To reduce tissue inflammation
- **Warmth and quiet environment**: To reduce metabolic demand
- **Monitoring**: Intensive care with continuous monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function

Despite aggressive supportive care, the mortality rate for avocado toxicosis in birds is high.

## Prevention

Prevention is the only reliable protection against avocado toxicity:

- **Never feed any part of an avocado** to any bird species
- Remove avocado plants from areas accessible to birds
- Store avocados in sealed containers or areas birds cannot access
- Wash hands, cutting boards, and utensils after handling avocado before interacting with birds
- Educate all household members about avocado dangers to birds
- Do not allow birds near kitchen areas during avocado preparation
- Read ingredient labels on prepared foods to check for avocado content

## Prognosis

Prognosis is poor to grave once clinical signs appear. Death frequently occurs within 12 to 48 hours of ingestion, even with aggressive veterinary treatment. Birds that receive immediate supportive care after very small exposures may occasionally survive, but cardiac damage can be permanent. The severity of poisoning depends on the amount ingested relative to body size and the concentration of persin in the specific avocado variety. Given the lack of an antidote and the high mortality rate, complete prevention remains essential.
