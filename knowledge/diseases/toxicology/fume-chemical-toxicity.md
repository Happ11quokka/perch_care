# Fume and Chemical Toxicity in Parrots

## Overview

Parrots possess a highly efficient respiratory system with air sacs and cross-current gas exchange that makes them extraordinarily sensitive to airborne toxins. Fume and chemical toxicity is a leading cause of sudden death in pet birds. The most notorious culprit is polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the non-stick coating marketed as Teflon, which releases toxic fumes when overheated. However, numerous other household fumes, aerosols, and chemicals are equally dangerous. Because of the speed at which inhaled toxins affect birds, prevention is the only reliable protection, as death can occur within minutes of exposure.

## Affected Species

All bird species are highly susceptible to airborne toxins due to their efficient respiratory anatomy. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, finches, and canaries may die more rapidly due to their higher metabolic rate and relatively larger respiratory volume per body mass. Larger parrots including macaws, cockatoos, Amazon Parrots, and African Grey Parrots are also at extreme risk. Historically, canaries were used as sentinel animals in coal mines precisely because of their acute sensitivity to toxic gases.

## Causes

**PTFE/Teflon fumes:**
- Overheated non-stick cookware (pans, pots, baking sheets)
- Non-stick coatings on drip pans, waffle irons, bread machines, and air fryers
- Self-cleaning oven cycles that heat PTFE-coated surfaces to extreme temperatures
- PTFE-coated heat lamps, space heaters, and hair dryers
- Non-stick coated ironing board covers

**Aerosols and sprays:**
- Insecticides and pesticides
- Air fresheners and room deodorizers
- Hair spray, perfume, and cologne
- Spray-on sunscreen
- Furniture polish and cleaning sprays

**Other chemical fumes:**
- Scented candles and incense
- Cigarette, cigar, and marijuana smoke
- Paint fumes and paint stripper/remover
- New carpet off-gassing
- Bleach and ammonia fumes
- Oven cleaners
- Glue and adhesive fumes (especially super glue with cyanoacrylate)
- Carbon monoxide from faulty heating systems

## Symptoms

Onset is often extremely rapid, within minutes of exposure:

- Sudden death with no prior warning signs
- Severe respiratory distress: open-mouth breathing, tail bobbing, gasping
- Falling from perch
- Wheezing, clicking, or labored breathing sounds
- Discharge from nares (nostrils) or eyes
- Disorientation, ataxia, and tremors
- Seizures
- Cyanosis (blue discoloration)
- Loss of consciousness

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on history of exposure to fumes or chemicals combined with acute respiratory distress or sudden death. There is no specific test for PTFE poisoning. Post-mortem examination typically reveals pulmonary hemorrhage, edema, and congestion. History is the most critical diagnostic element: determining what was used, heated, sprayed, or burning in the environment prior to the onset of signs. Environmental assessment helps identify the specific source.

## Treatment

Treatment is limited and often unsuccessful due to the rapid, devastating nature of inhalation toxicosis:

- **Immediate removal** from the toxic environment to fresh air
- **Oxygen therapy**: Supplemental oxygen in an incubator or oxygen cage
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: Dexamethasone or other corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation
- **Bronchodilators**: To open airways and ease breathing
- **Fluid therapy**: To support hydration and circulation
- **Warmth and quiet**: Minimize stress and metabolic demand
- **Antibiotics**: To prevent secondary bacterial pneumonia in survivors

Many birds die before treatment can be initiated. Even with aggressive treatment, mortality rates for PTFE toxicosis remain very high.

## Prevention

Prevention is the only effective strategy:

- **Remove all PTFE/non-stick cookware** from the home; use stainless steel, cast iron, or ceramic cookware
- Never use the self-cleaning oven function with birds in the home
- Do not use aerosol sprays, air fresheners, or scented candles in areas accessible to birds
- Maintain excellent kitchen ventilation
- Keep birds out of the kitchen entirely
- Do not smoke near birds
- Use bird-safe cleaning products (vinegar, baking soda-based)
- Ensure carbon monoxide detectors are installed and functional
- Avoid new carpet installation with birds present; ventilate thoroughly before return
- Read product labels for PTFE/PFOA content in new appliances

## Prognosis

Prognosis for acute PTFE/fume toxicosis is grave. Many birds die within minutes of exposure, before any treatment can be provided. Birds that survive the initial exposure face potential chronic respiratory damage and may develop secondary infections. Those exposed to lower concentrations of non-PTFE fumes and treated promptly with oxygen and anti-inflammatories have a more variable prognosis depending on the specific toxin and duration of exposure. Chronic, low-level exposure to irritants can cause progressive respiratory disease with a guarded long-term outlook.
