# Medication Toxicity in Parrots

## Overview

Medication toxicity in parrots occurs when birds are exposed to human medications, inappropriately dosed avian medications, or veterinary drugs not intended for birds. Parrots have unique physiology and metabolic pathways that make them exceptionally sensitive to many medications that are safe for mammals. Even medications commonly used in veterinary practice for dogs and cats can be lethal to birds. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, and many over-the-counter human medications are particularly dangerous. The practice of medicating birds without veterinary guidance is a significant cause of preventable avian deaths.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to medication toxicity. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, parrotlets, and lovebirds are at heightened risk because even tiny quantities can represent a massive overdose relative to their body weight. Larger parrots may survive accidental exposure to small amounts of some medications, but are still at serious risk. Species differences in drug metabolism mean that a medication safe for one bird species may be toxic to another.

## Causes

**Highly dangerous human medications:**
- **Acetaminophen (Tylenol/paracetamol)**: Causes severe liver necrosis and methemoglobinemia; often fatal
- **NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin)**: Cause gastrointestinal ulceration, kidney failure, and death; birds lack the enzyme pathways to safely metabolize most NSAIDs
- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs and tricyclics can cause seizures and cardiac toxicity
- **ADHD medications (amphetamines)**: Cardiovascular collapse and seizures
- **Birth control pills**: Hormonal disruption and reproductive complications
- **Blood pressure medications**: Cardiovascular collapse
- **Sleep aids and benzodiazepines**: Respiratory depression and sedation

**Inappropriate avian medication use:**
- Incorrect dosing of prescribed avian medications
- Using dog or cat formulations without proper dose calculation
- Over-the-counter bird medications from pet stores (often inappropriate or outdated)
- Antibiotics without veterinary guidance leading to resistant infections or secondary fungal overgrowth
- Topical medications containing zinc oxide

**Accidental exposure:**
- Birds chewing on medication bottles or blister packs
- Medication dropped on floors or countertops
- Medicated food intended for other pets

## Symptoms

Symptoms vary depending on the specific medication but may include:

- Lethargy, depression, and fluffed appearance
- Regurgitation and vomiting
- Bloody droppings or diarrhea
- Seizures and tremors
- Ataxia and disorientation
- Respiratory depression or respiratory distress
- Increased or decreased heart rate
- Liver failure signs: biliverdinuria, jaundice
- Kidney failure signs: polyuria, gout
- Sudden collapse and death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies primarily on known or suspected medication exposure combined with compatible clinical signs. A thorough history is essential, including all medications in the household, recent administration of any drugs to the bird, and potential accidental access. Blood chemistry panel evaluates liver and kidney function. Complete blood count assesses for anemia and infection. Specific drug levels can sometimes be measured in blood but are not routinely available for avian patients. Crop contents may be analyzed for drug residues. Post-mortem examination may reveal organ-specific damage patterns.

## Treatment

- **Decontamination**: Crop lavage to remove unabsorbed medication if ingestion is recent
- **Activated charcoal**: To reduce further gastrointestinal absorption
- **Specific antidotes**: N-acetylcysteine for acetaminophen toxicity (if identified early); vitamin K1 for anticoagulant rodenticide ingestion
- **Fluid therapy**: Aggressive intravenous or subcutaneous fluids to support organ perfusion and promote excretion
- **Seizure control**: Diazepam or midazolam for neurological signs
- **GI protectants**: Sucralfate for GI ulceration from NSAIDs
- **Liver support**: Milk thistle (silymarin), hepatoprotective supplements
- **Supportive care**: Warmth, oxygen therapy, nutritional support, and stress reduction
- **Monitoring**: Serial blood work to track organ function

## Prevention

- **Never administer any medication to a bird without explicit veterinary direction**
- Store all medications in bird-proof containers in closed cabinets
- Do not leave medications on counters, nightstands, or other accessible surfaces
- Be aware that birds can open pill bottles and blister packs
- Do not use over-the-counter bird medications from pet stores without veterinary consultation
- Inform all household members about the dangers of medication exposure to birds
- Take medications in a room separate from the bird
- Ensure proper identification and dosing of all veterinarian-prescribed avian medications
- Use an avian veterinarian experienced in bird-specific pharmacology

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the specific medication, amount ingested, time to treatment, and the bird's size. Acetaminophen toxicity carries a very poor prognosis once liver damage is established. NSAID toxicity may be survivable with early, aggressive treatment including GI protectants and fluid therapy. Accidental exposure to small amounts of less toxic medications may have a good prognosis with prompt supportive care. The key factor in all cases is the speed of recognition and initiation of veterinary treatment.
