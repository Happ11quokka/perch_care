# Chocolate Toxicity in Parrots

## Overview

Chocolate toxicity in parrots is caused by the ingestion of theobromine and caffeine, two methylxanthine compounds naturally present in cacao products. Birds are highly sensitive to these substances, which affect the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and nervous systems. Even small amounts of chocolate can cause serious illness or death in parrots. Dark chocolate and baking chocolate contain the highest concentrations of theobromine and pose the greatest risk. Milk chocolate is lower but still toxic. White chocolate contains very little methylxanthine compared with darker chocolate, but white chocolate products should still be kept away from birds due to high sugar/fat content and potential cocoa-containing ingredients.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to chocolate toxicity. Smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, parrotlets, and lovebirds are at particular risk because even a tiny amount can deliver a proportionally large dose relative to their body weight. Larger parrots including Amazon Parrots, African Grey Parrots, macaws, and cockatoos are also affected, though they may tolerate slightly larger amounts before showing clinical signs. No parrot species is immune to the effects of theobromine and caffeine.

## Causes

- **Dark chocolate**: Contains the highest concentration of theobromine (approximately 130-450 mg per ounce)
- **Baking chocolate and cocoa powder**: Extremely concentrated sources of theobromine
- **Milk chocolate**: Lower concentration but still toxic to birds
- **White chocolate products**: Very low methylxanthines, but still inappropriate and potentially harmful as bird food
- **Chocolate-flavored foods**: Cookies, cakes, ice cream, and candy containing chocolate
- **Cocoa-containing beverages**: Hot chocolate, chocolate milk, mocha coffee drinks
- **Chocolate-covered items**: Raisins, nuts, or fruits with chocolate coating
- **Accidental access**: Birds reaching food left unattended on counters or tables

## Dose Considerations

- A validated avian LD50 for theobromine/caffeine has not been established for companion parrots.
- Risk depends on chocolate type (cocoa concentration), amount ingested, and bird body weight.
- Published avian case data are limited, but a fatal case has been reported in a Kea after dark-chocolate ingestion with an estimated dose of approximately 250 mg/kg theobromine and 20 mg/kg caffeine.

## Symptoms

Symptoms may appear within 1-4 hours of ingestion and include:

- **Gastrointestinal signs**: Vomiting, regurgitation, diarrhea, increased thirst
- **Cardiovascular signs**: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension
- **Neurological signs**: Hyperactivity, restlessness, tremors, seizures
- **Respiratory signs**: Rapid breathing, panting
- **General signs**: Dark-colored droppings, lethargy following initial hyperactivity, dehydration
- **Severe cases**: Collapse, cardiac arrest, and death

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based primarily on history of chocolate exposure combined with compatible clinical signs. There is no rapid point-of-care test for theobromine levels in birds. Physical examination may reveal tachycardia, arrhythmias, hyperexcitability, or neurological abnormalities. Blood chemistry panel and complete blood count help assess organ function and overall status. Crop contents may be evaluated if ingestion is recent. Radiographs are generally not diagnostic but may be performed to assess for other complications.

## Treatment

There is **no specific antidote** for chocolate poisoning in birds. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic:

- **Crop lavage**: If ingestion is very recent, flushing the crop to remove undigested chocolate
- **Activated charcoal**: May help reduce further absorption of theobromine if administered early
- **Fluid therapy**: Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids to support hydration and promote theobromine excretion
- **Seizure control**: Diazepam or midazolam for active seizures
- **Cardiac monitoring and treatment**: Anti-arrhythmic medications as needed
- **Temperature regulation**: Monitoring and maintaining normal body temperature
- **Quiet, stress-free environment**: Reducing stimulation to minimize cardiac workload

## Prevention

- Never feed chocolate or chocolate-containing products to any bird
- Store all chocolate products in sealed containers in bird-inaccessible areas
- Do not leave chocolate foods unattended where birds can reach them
- Educate all household members, especially children, about chocolate dangers to birds
- Be cautious during holidays when chocolate is more prevalent (Halloween, Easter, Valentine's Day)
- Supervise birds closely when out of their cage in areas where food is present
- Check ingredient lists on treats or foods shared near birds

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the type and amount of chocolate consumed relative to the bird's body weight, as well as how quickly treatment is initiated. Small amounts of milk chocolate ingested by larger parrots may result in mild GI upset with a good prognosis if treated promptly. Ingestion of dark chocolate, baking chocolate, or cocoa powder carries a more guarded to poor prognosis, especially in smaller species. Severe cardiac arrhythmias and status epilepticus are poor prognostic indicators. Early veterinary intervention significantly improves survival chances.
