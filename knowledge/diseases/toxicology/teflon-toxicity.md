# Teflon Toxicity (PTFE Toxicosis)

## Overview

Teflon toxicity, or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) toxicosis, is one of the most rapidly fatal environmental toxicities affecting pet parrots. When non-stick cookware and other PTFE-coated products are overheated (typically above 280 degrees Celsius / 536 degrees Fahrenheit), they release colorless, odorless toxic fumes containing particulate matter and gases including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and other fluoropolymer degradation products. These fumes cause severe, acute damage to the avian respiratory system, leading to hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, air sac hemorrhage, and death, often within minutes to hours of exposure. The avian respiratory system is uniquely vulnerable due to its highly efficient gas exchange mechanism, which means toxic particles are absorbed rapidly and extensively.

## Affected Species

All bird species are extremely susceptible to PTFE fumes, with no species known to be resistant. Parrots of all sizes, from budgerigars to macaws, are affected. Smaller species may die more rapidly due to their higher respiratory rate and smaller body mass, but all birds, regardless of size, can be killed by PTFE fume exposure. Birds housed in or near kitchens are at greatest risk. The toxicity is not limited to parrots; canaries, finches, and all other pet birds are equally vulnerable.

## Causes

The cause is inhalation of toxic fumes released from overheated PTFE-coated (non-stick) products. Common sources include non-stick cookware (frying pans, saucepans, baking sheets), self-cleaning oven cycles (which heat residual coatings to extreme temperatures), non-stick waffle irons and griddles, PTFE-coated drip pans, non-stick bread machines, hair dryers with PTFE-coated heating elements, space heaters with PTFE-coated elements, heat lamps with PTFE coating, non-stick irons, and some stovetop burner liners. Fumes can travel throughout a home via ventilation systems, affecting birds in rooms distant from the kitchen. Even brief overheating of non-stick cookware left on a burner can release lethal concentrations of fumes.

## Symptoms

Onset is acute and rapidly progressive:
- Sudden onset of respiratory distress
- Open-mouth breathing and gasping
- Tail bobbing (severe respiratory effort)
- Falling from perch
- Ataxia and incoordination
- Wheezing or crackling respiratory sounds
- Cyanosis (blue discoloration of skin)
- Convulsions
- Death, often within minutes to hours of exposure
- Some birds are found dead with no preceding clinical signs observed

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is typically based on the history of exposure to overheated non-stick products and the acute onset of respiratory distress or death in the bird. There is no specific diagnostic test for PTFE toxicosis in live birds. Post-mortem examination (necropsy) reveals severe pulmonary congestion, hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, and hemorrhage in the lungs and air sacs. Histopathology shows necrosis and hemorrhage of the respiratory epithelium with edema fluid filling the air capillaries and parabronchi. The diagnosis is often presumptive, based on the combination of acute respiratory death and confirmed exposure to overheated PTFE products.

## Treatment

There is no specific antidote for PTFE toxicosis, and treatment is largely futile once significant exposure has occurred. If a bird is found alive after suspected exposure, immediate removal from the contaminated environment into fresh air is the first step. Supportive care may include oxygen therapy, anti-inflammatory medications (dexamethasone), and diuretics to address pulmonary edema. Fluid therapy and warmth should be provided. However, the prognosis even with aggressive treatment is extremely poor once clinical signs have developed. Most birds that develop respiratory signs from PTFE exposure die despite treatment efforts.

## Prevention

Prevention is the ONLY reliable approach to PTFE toxicosis:
- Remove all non-stick (PTFE-coated) cookware from the home entirely
- Replace with stainless steel, cast iron, ceramic, or glass cookware
- Never use the self-cleaning function on ovens when birds are in the home
- Remove or avoid PTFE-coated appliances (hair dryers, space heaters, irons, heat lamps)
- Never allow cookware to overheat on the stove, even non-PTFE cookware
- Ensure adequate kitchen ventilation
- Never house birds in or directly adjacent to the kitchen
- Educate all household members and visitors about the danger
- Consider the risk from PTFE sources beyond the kitchen (space heaters, haircare appliances)

## Prognosis

The prognosis for PTFE toxicosis is grave. Once a bird has inhaled significant quantities of PTFE fumes and developed clinical signs, death is the most common outcome. Even birds that receive immediate veterinary care rarely survive acute PTFE toxicosis. Birds that survive initial exposure may develop chronic respiratory disease from permanent lung damage. Prevention through complete elimination of PTFE-containing products from the bird's environment is the only effective strategy. Every parrot owner must be educated about this risk before acquiring a bird.
