# Gout in Parrots

## Overview

Gout is a metabolic condition resulting from the abnormal accumulation of uric acid crystals in the body. In birds, uric acid is the primary waste product of protein metabolism, excreted by the kidneys. When renal function is compromised or uric acid production exceeds the kidneys' excretory capacity, uric acid levels in the blood rise (hyperuricemia) and urate crystals deposit in tissues. Gout in parrots occurs in two forms: articular gout, which affects joints, and visceral gout, which involves uric acid deposition on internal organ surfaces.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are susceptible to gout, though it is most commonly diagnosed in budgerigars, cockatiels, and other smaller psittacines. Older parrots of any species with underlying kidney disease are at increased risk. Species predisposed to renal disease, including Amazon Parrots and macaws, may develop gout as a secondary complication. Neonatal birds receiving improperly formulated hand-feeding diets may also develop visceral gout.

## Causes

- **Kidney dysfunction**: Primary renal disease from any cause leading to impaired uric acid excretion
- **Dehydration**: Chronic or severe dehydration concentrating uric acid in the blood
- **High-protein diets**: Excessive dietary protein increasing uric acid production
- **Nephrotoxic drugs**: Aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin), certain antifungals
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Causing renal tubular damage
- **Heavy metal toxicity**: Lead and zinc damaging the kidneys
- **Infectious nephritis**: Bacterial or viral kidney infections
- **Congenital renal abnormalities**: Structural kidney defects

## Symptoms

**Articular gout:**
- Swollen, painful joints, particularly in the toes and feet
- White to yellowish nodules (tophi) visible under the skin over joints
- Lameness and reluctance to perch or walk
- Shifting weight between feet
- Decreased grip strength

**Visceral gout:**
- Lethargy and depression
- Decreased or absent appetite
- Fluffed appearance
- Polyuria (watery droppings)
- Rapid decline and death (visceral gout is often acute and severe)
- White chalky deposits on organ surfaces found at necropsy

## Diagnosis

Blood chemistry showing elevated uric acid levels supports the diagnosis, though normal levels do not rule it out. Radiographs may reveal joint swelling or mineralized deposits in articular gout. Aspiration of joint swellings showing urate crystals under microscopy is confirmatory for articular gout. Complete blood count and additional blood chemistry assess overall kidney function and identify underlying causes. Ultrasound may detect organ changes consistent with visceral gout. Definitive diagnosis of visceral gout is usually made at necropsy, with characteristic white urate deposits visible on serosal surfaces of organs.

## Treatment

- **Allopurinol**: Xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces uric acid production; the cornerstone of medical management
- **Colchicine**: Anti-inflammatory agent used to reduce urate crystal inflammation
- **Fluid therapy**: Aggressive hydration to promote uric acid excretion
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam or other NSAIDs appropriate for birds to manage joint pain
- **Dietary modification**: Reduce dietary protein content; transition to balanced pelleted diet with vegetables
- **Surgical debulking**: Removal of accessible tophi in articular gout cases
- **Treat underlying cause**: Address renal disease, dehydration, or toxin exposure
- **Vitamin A supplementation**: If deficiency is a contributing factor

## Prevention

- Ensure constant access to clean, fresh water to prevent dehydration
- Feed a species-appropriate balanced diet without excessive protein
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications when possible; monitor renal function during use
- Provide adequate dietary vitamin A through dark leafy greens and orange vegetables
- Remove sources of heavy metals from the environment
- Obtain regular veterinary checkups with blood work to monitor kidney function
- Use properly formulated hand-feeding formulas for neonates

## Prognosis

Articular gout can often be managed long-term with allopurinol, dietary modification, and pain management, providing a fair prognosis for quality of life. However, the underlying kidney disease is typically progressive. Visceral gout carries a poor to grave prognosis, as it usually indicates severe, acute renal failure with extensive organ involvement. Early detection and management of kidney disease is the most effective strategy to prevent gout from developing.
