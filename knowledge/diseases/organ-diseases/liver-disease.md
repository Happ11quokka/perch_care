# Liver Disease (Hepatopathy) in Parrots

## Overview

Liver disease, or hepatopathy, is one of the most commonly diagnosed organ disorders in pet parrots. The liver plays critical roles in metabolism, detoxification, protein synthesis, bile production, and nutrient storage. When the liver is compromised, a wide range of systemic effects can occur. Hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease) is the most prevalent form in pet birds, often resulting from high-fat, seed-based diets. Liver disease can range from mild, reversible changes to severe, life-threatening hepatic failure.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop liver disease. Amazon Parrots, cockatoos, budgerigars, and cockatiels are particularly susceptible to hepatic lipidosis due to their tendency toward obesity on seed diets. African Grey Parrots and Quaker Parrots are also frequently affected. Younger birds may develop liver disease from infectious causes or toxin exposure.

## Causes

- **Hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver)**: High-fat diets, obesity, and sedentary lifestyle
- **Infectious agents**: Chlamydia psittaci, Pacheco disease (herpesvirus), polyomavirus, bacterial infections, and aspergillosis
- **Toxins**: Heavy metals (lead, zinc), aflatoxins from moldy food, and certain medications
- **Metabolic disorders**: Iron storage disease (hemochromatosis), particularly in mynahs and toucans but occasionally in parrots
- **Neoplasia**: Primary liver tumors or metastatic disease
- **Chronic malnutrition**: Vitamin A deficiency and amino acid imbalances

## Symptoms

- Biliverdinuria (bright green or yellow urates indicating bile pigment in urine)
- Overgrown or flaky beak and nails
- Feather discoloration, poor feather quality, or feather loss
- Abdominal distension (hepatomegaly or ascites)
- Lethargy and decreased appetite
- Weight loss or obesity depending on the stage and cause
- Coagulopathy (abnormal bleeding or bruising)
- Polyuria and polydipsia
- Regurgitation or vomiting
- Neurological signs in severe hepatic encephalopathy

## Diagnosis

A thorough diagnostic workup is essential. Blood chemistry panel is critical, evaluating AST (aspartate aminotransferase), bile acids, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, and uric acid. Elevated bile acids are the most sensitive indicator of liver dysfunction. Complete blood count may show anemia or abnormal white cell counts. Radiographs often reveal hepatomegaly (enlarged liver shadow). Ultrasound can assess liver texture, identify masses, and detect ascites. Liver biopsy provides definitive diagnosis and histological characterization. PCR testing and cultures help identify infectious causes.

## Treatment

- **Dietary correction**: Transition from seed-based to balanced pelleted diet with fresh vegetables; essential for hepatic lipidosis
- **Lactulose**: To reduce ammonia levels in hepatic encephalopathy
- **Milk thistle (silymarin)**: Hepatoprotective supplement commonly used in avian medicine
- **Antibiotics or antifungals**: For infectious hepatitis
- **Chelation therapy**: For heavy metal-induced liver damage
- **Fluid therapy**: To correct dehydration and support hepatic perfusion
- **Vitamin supplementation**: Vitamin A, E, K, and B-complex vitamins
- **Anti-inflammatory medications**: As directed by the veterinarian

## Prevention

- Feed a nutritionally balanced diet based on formulated pellets with fresh produce
- Limit high-fat seeds and nuts
- Maintain a healthy body weight
- Store food properly to prevent mold and aflatoxin contamination
- Remove heavy metal sources from the environment
- Schedule annual veterinary exams with blood work for early detection

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies based on the underlying cause and severity. Hepatic lipidosis caught early often responds well to dietary correction and supportive care, with good recovery potential. Infectious hepatitis prognosis depends on the pathogen and response to treatment. Toxin-induced liver damage may be reversible if exposure is eliminated promptly. Advanced liver failure with coagulopathy and encephalopathy carries a poor prognosis. Regular monitoring of blood parameters guides treatment success.
