# Kidney Disease (Renal Disease) in Parrots

## Overview

Kidney disease in parrots involves impaired renal function that disrupts the body's ability to filter waste products, regulate electrolytes, and maintain fluid balance. The avian kidney differs from mammalian kidneys in that birds excrete uric acid rather than urea as their primary nitrogenous waste product. Kidney disease can be acute or chronic, and because birds have a remarkable capacity to compensate for renal impairment, clinical signs often do not appear until significant kidney damage has already occurred.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can develop kidney disease. Budgerigars are particularly predisposed to renal tumors and gout. Cockatiels, Amazon Parrots, macaws, and African Grey Parrots are also commonly affected. Older birds are at greater risk for chronic renal disease. Dehydration-prone species and those on all-seed diets face increased risk.

## Causes

- **Dehydration**: Chronic or severe dehydration causing renal ischemia
- **High-protein diets**: Excessive protein intake straining the renal system
- **Infectious agents**: Bacterial nephritis, polyomavirus, and Chlamydia psittaci
- **Toxins**: Heavy metals (lead, zinc), aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin), and other nephrotoxic drugs
- **Vitamin A deficiency**: Causing metaplasia of renal tubular epithelium
- **Gout**: Uric acid deposition damaging renal tissue
- **Neoplasia**: Renal tumors, especially common in budgerigars
- **Age-related degeneration**: Progressive loss of nephron function

## Symptoms

- Polyuria (increased urine output, watery droppings)
- Polydipsia (increased water intake)
- Lethargy and decreased activity
- Weight loss and poor body condition
- Decreased or absent appetite
- Swollen joints (in cases of articular gout)
- Lameness or leg weakness (kidney enlargement pressing on sciatic nerve)
- Regurgitation
- Dehydration signs: sunken eyes, skin tenting
- Ruffled feathers and fluffed appearance
- Sudden death in acute renal failure

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis requires comprehensive blood work. Blood chemistry panel evaluating uric acid levels is essential, though elevated uric acid indicates significant renal compromise (approximately 70% or more loss of function). Blood urea nitrogen may also be elevated. Complete blood count can reveal anemia of chronic disease or infection. Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, calcium, phosphorus) may be present. Radiographs may show renomegaly (enlarged kidneys). Ultrasound helps assess kidney size, shape, and texture. Urinalysis, when obtainable, provides additional information. Biopsy is definitive for identifying the cause of renal disease.

## Treatment

- **Fluid therapy**: Aggressive hydration with intravenous or subcutaneous fluids to support renal perfusion
- **Dietary modification**: Reduce protein levels and ensure balanced nutrition; transition to high-quality pelleted diet
- **Allopurinol**: For hyperuricemia and gout to reduce uric acid production
- **Antibiotics**: For bacterial nephritis based on culture and sensitivity
- **Vitamin A supplementation**: If deficiency is a contributing factor
- **Diuretics**: In select cases to promote urine flow
- **Pain management**: Meloxicam or other appropriate analgesics for gout-associated pain
- **Discontinue nephrotoxic medications**: Remove any contributing drug exposure

## Prevention

- Ensure constant access to clean, fresh water
- Feed a balanced diet appropriate for the species, avoiding excessive protein
- Provide adequate vitamin A through diet or supplementation
- Avoid nephrotoxic medications unless absolutely necessary and monitor kidney function
- Remove heavy metal sources from the bird's environment
- Schedule annual veterinary exams with blood chemistry panels

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the cause and extent of renal damage. Acute kidney injury from dehydration or toxin exposure may be reversible with aggressive fluid therapy if treated promptly. Chronic kidney disease is generally progressive and irreversible, though supportive management can maintain quality of life for months to years. Renal tumors in budgerigars carry a poor prognosis. Gout secondary to kidney disease can be managed but not cured. Early detection through routine blood work is key to improving outcomes.
