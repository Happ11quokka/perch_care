# Atherosclerosis in Parrots

## Overview

Atherosclerosis is a progressive cardiovascular condition characterized by the buildup of fatty plaques (atheromas) within arterial walls, leading to narrowing and hardening of the arteries. In parrots, this disease primarily affects the major arteries including the aorta, brachiocephalic arteries, and coronary arteries. Atherosclerosis is a significant cause of sudden death in older pet parrots and is strongly associated with high-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles. The disease often goes undetected until a catastrophic event such as stroke, heart attack, or aortic rupture occurs.

## Affected Species

Certain parrot species are disproportionately affected by atherosclerosis. Amazon Parrots, African Grey Parrots, and cockatoos are the most commonly diagnosed species. Quaker Parrots (Monk Parakeets) are also highly predisposed. The condition is more frequently seen in older birds, particularly those over 15 years of age, and in birds fed high-fat seed-based diets over prolonged periods. Both males and females are affected.

## Causes

- **High-fat diet**: Seed-only or seed-heavy diets with excessive sunflower seeds, peanuts, and other high-fat items
- **Lack of exercise**: Sedentary lifestyle with limited flight or physical activity
- **Obesity**: Excessive body weight contributing to lipid metabolism dysfunction
- **Age**: Increased prevalence in older parrots
- **Genetic predisposition**: Species-specific susceptibility
- **Chronic stress and hormonal factors**: Elevated cortisol and reproductive hormones
- **Lack of dietary variety**: Deficiencies in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants

## Symptoms

Atherosclerosis is often called a "silent killer" because clinical signs may not appear until the disease is advanced:

- Sudden death with no prior symptoms (most common presentation)
- Exercise intolerance and lethargy
- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing)
- Syncope (fainting episodes)
- Neurological signs if stroke occurs (ataxia, head tilt, seizures)
- Peripheral signs: cold feet, cyanotic (blue) nails or skin
- Abdominal distension from liver congestion

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is challenging in living birds. Radiographs may reveal mineralized arterial walls in advanced cases. Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) can assess heart function and identify cardiomegaly. Blood chemistry including cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein levels may indicate elevated lipids. CT angiography is the most definitive imaging modality but is not widely available for avian patients. Definitive diagnosis is often made post-mortem during necropsy.

## Treatment

There is no cure for established atherosclerosis, and treatment focuses on slowing progression and managing complications:

- **Dietary modification**: Transition from seed-based to a balanced pelleted diet with fresh vegetables and limited high-fat foods
- **Weight management**: Gradual weight loss through diet and increased activity
- **Exercise encouragement**: Foraging opportunities, flight exercise, and enrichment
- **Lipid-lowering agents**: Some avian veterinarians may prescribe statins or omega-3 fatty acid supplements
- **Cardiovascular support**: Treatment of secondary heart failure if present

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, low-fat diet based on formulated pellets supplemented with fresh vegetables and fruits
- Limit seeds and nuts to small amounts as treats only
- Encourage regular physical activity and flight
- Maintain a healthy body weight
- Provide annual veterinary wellness exams including blood lipid screening for at-risk species
- Minimize chronic stress through environmental enrichment

## Prognosis

Prognosis is guarded to poor once significant atherosclerosis is established, as the arterial changes are largely irreversible. Early dietary intervention and lifestyle modification can slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Birds with severe atherosclerosis are at constant risk of sudden death from vascular events. Prevention through proper diet and exercise from a young age remains the most effective strategy.
