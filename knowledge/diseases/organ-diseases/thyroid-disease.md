# Thyroid Disease in Parrots

## Overview

Thyroid disease in parrots involves dysfunction of the thyroid gland, which produces hormones essential for regulating metabolism, growth, feather development, and reproductive function. Both hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) and hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) can occur in pet birds, though hypothyroidism is more frequently suspected. Thyroid disease remains one of the more challenging endocrine conditions to definitively diagnose in avian medicine due to limited reference ranges and the difficulty of measuring avian thyroid hormones accurately.

## Affected Species

Thyroid disease is most commonly reported in budgerigars, cockatiels, and Amazon Parrots. Budgerigars have a well-documented association between thyroid dysfunction and lipomas (fatty tumors). Cockatoos and African Grey Parrots may also be affected. The condition can occur at any age but is more frequently suspected in middle-aged to older birds. Species fed iodine-deficient diets, particularly all-seed diets, are at increased risk for goiter and hypothyroidism.

## Causes

- **Iodine deficiency**: All-seed diets lacking adequate iodine, leading to goiter (thyroid enlargement) and hypothyroidism
- **Goitrogenic foods**: Excessive intake of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cabbage, kale) that interfere with iodine uptake when dietary iodine is already marginal
- **Thyroid tumors**: Adenomas or carcinomas of the thyroid gland
- **Autoimmune thyroiditis**: Immune-mediated destruction of thyroid tissue (rare but reported)
- **Age-related degeneration**: Progressive decline in thyroid function
- **Environmental factors**: Chronic exposure to goitrogenic substances

## Symptoms

**Hypothyroidism:**
- Obesity and difficulty losing weight
- Lethargy and decreased activity
- Poor feather quality, delayed molting, or feather loss
- Cold intolerance
- Lipoma formation, particularly in budgerigars
- Reproductive dysfunction
- Slow growth in young birds

**Hyperthyroidism (less common):**
- Weight loss despite normal or increased appetite
- Hyperactivity or restlessness
- Increased heart rate
- Polyuria and polydipsia

**Goiter (enlarged thyroid):**
- Difficulty breathing or change in voice
- Regurgitation or crop dysfunction due to esophageal compression
- Visible swelling at the base of the neck (in severe cases)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis of thyroid disease in birds is challenging. Blood levels of total T4 (thyroxine) and free T4 can be measured, though species-specific reference ranges are limited. TSH stimulation testing is not widely standardized for avian species. Radiographs or ultrasound may detect thyroid enlargement (goiter) or masses. Cytology or biopsy of thyroid tissue provides definitive diagnosis for neoplasia. Clinical response to thyroid supplementation trial may be used as a diagnostic tool for suspected hypothyroidism. Complete blood work and lipid profiles help assess metabolic status.

## Treatment

- **Iodine supplementation**: For iodine-deficiency goiter; Lugol's iodine solution in drinking water under veterinary guidance
- **Levothyroxine (T4 supplementation)**: Synthetic thyroid hormone replacement for confirmed hypothyroidism
- **Dietary correction**: Transition to a balanced pelleted diet that includes adequate iodine
- **Surgical excision**: For thyroid tumors when accessible and operable
- **Weight management**: Dietary modification and exercise encouragement for obese birds
- **Anti-thyroid medication**: Methimazole for rare hyperthyroid cases

## Prevention

- Feed a balanced, formulated diet with adequate iodine content
- Avoid exclusive seed-based diets, which are typically iodine-deficient
- Moderate goitrogenic vegetable intake, especially when dietary iodine is limited
- Provide iodine-enriched mineral blocks as a supplement
- Schedule regular veterinary checkups for early detection of thyroid abnormalities
- Monitor body weight trends over time

## Prognosis

Prognosis for iodine-deficiency goiter is generally good with dietary correction and iodine supplementation. Hypothyroidism managed with levothyroxine supplementation can have a fair to good prognosis with regular monitoring. Thyroid tumors carry a variable prognosis depending on tumor type and whether surgical removal is feasible. Lipomas associated with thyroid dysfunction in budgerigars may improve with thyroid management and dietary changes. Overall, early recognition and treatment of thyroid disease improves outcomes significantly.
