# Heart Disease in Parrots

## Overview

Heart disease in parrots encompasses a range of cardiac conditions including cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), congestive heart failure, pericardial effusion, valvular disease, and arrhythmias. Avian cardiology is a challenging field because birds are adept at hiding illness, and cardiac disease often remains subclinical until it reaches an advanced stage. The avian heart beats significantly faster than mammalian hearts, and structural differences make diagnosis and treatment distinct from mammalian cardiology.

## Affected Species

Heart disease can occur in all parrot species. Amazon Parrots, African Grey Parrots, cockatoos, and macaws are most commonly diagnosed, partly because of their longer lifespans and predisposition to atherosclerosis. Budgerigars and cockatiels may also develop cardiac conditions. Older birds and those on poor diets are at higher risk.

## Causes

- **Atherosclerosis**: The most common underlying cause of cardiac disease in parrots
- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin E, selenium, and amino acid deficiencies
- **High-fat diets**: Chronic intake of excessive dietary fat leading to lipid accumulation
- **Infectious diseases**: Bacterial endocarditis, viral myocarditis, and fungal infections
- **Toxin exposure**: Heavy metals, certain medications, and environmental toxins
- **Age-related degeneration**: Valvular insufficiency and myocardial fibrosis in older birds
- **Congenital defects**: Rarely reported but possible in pet birds

## Symptoms

- Exercise intolerance and reluctance to fly or climb
- Dyspnea (labored breathing), particularly after exertion
- Ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen causing distension)
- Cyanosis (bluish discoloration of feet, nails, or skin)
- Syncope (fainting or collapse)
- Lethargy and decreased activity levels
- Coughing or wheezing
- Sudden death without prior clinical signs
- Weight loss or poor body condition despite normal appetite

## Diagnosis

Diagnosing heart disease in parrots requires a combination of methods. Auscultation may reveal murmurs, arrhythmias, or muffled heart sounds. Radiographs can detect cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or hepatomegaly from venous congestion. Echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) is the gold standard for evaluating chamber size, wall thickness, valve function, and contractility. Electrocardiography (ECG) identifies arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities. Blood chemistry including cholesterol, triglycerides, and cardiac biomarkers provides supportive information. Advanced imaging such as CT may be available at specialty practices.

## Treatment

- **Diuretics**: Furosemide to reduce fluid accumulation in congestive heart failure
- **ACE inhibitors**: Enalapril or benazepril for afterload reduction
- **Cardiac glycosides**: Digoxin in select cases for improved contractility
- **Dietary management**: Transition to low-fat, balanced diet with reduced sodium
- **Exercise modification**: Controlled activity levels to prevent cardiac overload
- **Pericardiocentesis**: Drainage of pericardial effusion if present
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, fluid management, and stress reduction

## Prevention

- Provide a balanced, low-fat diet from an early age
- Encourage regular physical activity and flight opportunities
- Maintain a healthy body weight
- Schedule annual veterinary exams with radiographs for older or at-risk species
- Minimize exposure to toxins and chronic stressors
- Ensure adequate dietary vitamin E and selenium

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by the type and severity of heart disease. Early-stage disease managed with dietary changes and medication may be stabilized for months to years. Congestive heart failure carries a guarded prognosis, though quality of life can be maintained with diuretics and supportive care. Advanced cardiomyopathy and severe valvular disease generally have a poor long-term prognosis. Regular monitoring with echocardiography helps guide treatment adjustments.
