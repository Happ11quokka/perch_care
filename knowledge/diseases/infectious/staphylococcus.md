# Staphylococcus Infections

## Overview
Staphylococcus infections in parrots are caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* and other coagulase-positive staphylococci, which are gram-positive, opportunistic bacteria. These organisms commonly inhabit the skin and mucous membranes but can cause significant disease when they breach normal defense barriers. Staphylococcal infections in birds range from localized skin and soft tissue infections, including the characteristic bumblefoot (pododermatitis), to severe systemic septicemia.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible to staphylococcal infections. Larger, heavier species such as macaws, cockatoos, and Amazon parrots are particularly prone to bumblefoot due to the greater pressure on their feet. Budgerigars and cockatiels commonly develop staphylococcal skin infections and abscesses. Birds housed on inappropriate perching surfaces (such as smooth dowel perches or sandpaper-covered perches) are at increased risk for foot infections. Obese birds and those with restricted mobility face elevated risk due to chronic pressure on the plantar surface of the feet.

## Causes
*Staphylococcus aureus* is the primary pathogenic species, though *S. intermedius* and other coagulase-positive species can also cause disease. The bacteria commonly reside on the skin and in the environment. Infection typically occurs through breaks in the skin caused by trauma, rough perching surfaces, self-mutilation, bites, or surgical wounds. Bumblefoot develops when chronic pressure or abrasion damages the plantar skin of the feet, allowing bacterial invasion. Predisposing factors include obesity, vitamin A deficiency (which compromises epithelial integrity), poor perch design, lack of exercise, and immunosuppression.

## Symptoms
Bumblefoot (pododermatitis) is the most recognizable staphylococcal infection, presenting as swelling, redness, and scab formation on the plantar surface of the feet, progressing through stages from mild inflammation to deep abscess formation with tendon and bone involvement. Skin infections appear as localized swellings, abscesses, or dermatitis. Wound infections show redness, swelling, discharge, and delayed healing. Systemic staphylococcal infections cause lethargy, fluffed feathers, anorexia, and fever. Septic arthritis presents as joint swelling and lameness. Osteomyelitis can develop when infection extends into bone, causing chronic pain and disability.

## Diagnosis
Culture and sensitivity testing from swabs of affected skin, abscess material, or blood (in septicemic cases) provides definitive diagnosis and guides antibiotic selection. Gram staining reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters. Cytology of abscess material typically shows dense caseous material (in birds, abscesses tend to be solid rather than liquid as in mammals). Radiographs are important for bumblefoot cases to assess bone involvement and for detecting osteomyelitis. Complete blood counts may show heterophilia in systemic infections. Biopsy may be necessary to differentiate from neoplasia or other granulomatous conditions.

## Treatment
Treatment depends on the location and severity of infection. Bumblefoot requires a multimodal approach including appropriate perch modifications, bandaging, topical wound care, and systemic antibiotics. Surgical debridement of abscesses may be necessary, as avian abscesses contain caseous material that does not drain like mammalian abscesses. Antibiotic selection should be guided by sensitivity testing; commonly effective drugs include cephalosporins (cephalexin), amoxicillin-clavulanate, and clindamycin. Addressing underlying causes such as vitamin A deficiency, obesity, and inappropriate perching is essential. Anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed for pain management.

## Prevention
Provide natural wood perches of varying diameters to promote foot health and prevent pressure sores. Avoid sandpaper perch covers and smooth dowel perches. Maintain birds at healthy body weights through proper diet and exercise opportunities. Ensure adequate vitamin A intake through diet (dark leafy greens, orange vegetables) or supplementation. Keep enclosures clean to minimize bacterial load. Promptly treat any skin wounds or abrasions to prevent secondary infection. Regular foot examinations should be part of routine health assessments.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for localized staphylococcal infections, including early-stage bumblefoot, is generally good with appropriate treatment and husbandry corrections. Advanced bumblefoot with bone and tendon involvement carries a more guarded prognosis and may require prolonged treatment. Systemic staphylococcal infections and septicemia have a guarded to poor prognosis. Recurrence is common if predisposing factors are not adequately addressed. Long-term management of chronic bumblefoot may be necessary in some cases.
