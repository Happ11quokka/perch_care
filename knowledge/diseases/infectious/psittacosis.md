# Psittacosis (Chlamydiosis)

## Overview
Psittacosis, also known as chlamydiosis or parrot fever, is a serious bacterial infection caused by *Chlamydia psittaci* (formerly *Chlamydophila psittaci*). It is one of the most significant zoonotic diseases transmitted from birds to humans, capable of causing severe pneumonia in people. The disease is reportable in many jurisdictions and remains a major public health concern associated with pet bird ownership.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible to psittacosis, but cockatiels, budgerigars, Amazon parrots, and macaws are among the most commonly affected. Cockatiel infections are particularly notable because these birds frequently carry the organism asymptomatically and shed it during periods of stress. Young, recently imported, or immunocompromised birds are at heightened risk for developing clinical disease.

## Causes
The causative agent is *Chlamydia psittaci*, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Transmission occurs primarily through inhalation of aerosolized dried fecal material, feather dust, or respiratory secretions from infected birds. The organism can survive in dried droppings for weeks to months, making environmental contamination a significant source of exposure. Vertical transmission from hen to chick and horizontal spread through shared food and water also occur. Stress, overcrowding, and concurrent illness can trigger shedding in carrier birds.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs are highly variable and may include lethargy, fluffed feathers, decreased appetite, and weight loss. Characteristic lime-green to yellow-green diarrhea is a hallmark sign resulting from hepatitis and biliverdinuria. Respiratory signs such as nasal discharge, sneezing, and dyspnea are common. Conjunctivitis with swollen, reddened eyes may be observed. In severe cases, birds develop hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and polyuria. Some birds remain asymptomatic carriers and shed the organism intermittently, particularly during stressful events.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical signs, history, and laboratory testing. PCR testing of combined choanal and cloacal swabs is considered the most reliable diagnostic method. Serology using elementary body agglutination (EBA) or complement fixation tests can detect antibodies, though paired titers showing a fourfold rise are more meaningful. Hematology often reveals heterophilia and elevated liver enzymes (AST, LDH). Radiographs may show hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Post-mortem findings include enlarged liver and spleen with fibrinous airsacculitis.

## Treatment
The treatment of choice is doxycycline administered for a minimum of 45 days. Oral doxycycline can be given directly or medicated in water, though water-based administration may result in inconsistent dosing. Injectable doxycycline hyclate (75-100 mg/kg IM every 5-7 days) provides more reliable blood levels. Supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support, and heat supplementation is essential. Calcium-rich foods and supplements should be avoided during treatment, as calcium chelates doxycycline and reduces its effectiveness. Environmental decontamination with quaternary ammonium disinfectants is critical.

## Prevention
Quarantine all new birds for a minimum of 30-45 days with appropriate testing before introduction to existing flocks. Maintain excellent hygiene with regular cage cleaning and disinfection. Minimize stress through proper husbandry, nutrition, and environmental management. Test birds prior to purchase when possible. Owners should be educated about the zoonotic risk and advised to seek medical attention if they develop flu-like symptoms after bird exposure.

## Prognosis
With prompt diagnosis and appropriate doxycycline therapy for the full 45-day course, the prognosis is generally good for uncomplicated cases. Severely debilitated birds or those with concurrent infections carry a guarded prognosis. Carrier states can persist even after treatment, and some birds may relapse during periods of stress. Human cases respond well to antibiotic therapy when diagnosed early.
