# Aspergillosis

## Overview

Aspergillosis is the most common fungal disease in pet parrots, caused primarily by *Aspergillus fumigatus* and occasionally other *Aspergillus* species. The disease occurs when birds inhale fungal spores (conidia) from the environment, leading to infection of the respiratory tract. Aspergillosis can present in acute or chronic forms, with chronic granulomatous aspergillosis being the most frequently seen presentation in companion parrots. The fungus thrives in warm, humid conditions and is ubiquitous in the environment, meaning immunocompromised or stressed birds are at greatest risk.

## Affected Species

African Grey Parrots, Amazon Parrots, Pionus Parrots, and raptors are considered the most susceptible. Young, recently imported, or immunosuppressed birds of any species can develop the disease. Birds kept in poorly ventilated environments or exposed to moldy bedding are at elevated risk.

## Causes

Aspergillosis results from inhalation of *Aspergillus fumigatus* spores found in contaminated food (especially corn and peanuts), moldy bedding, dusty environments, and decaying organic material. Predisposing factors include stress, malnutrition (especially vitamin A deficiency), immunosuppression, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and poor ventilation. The spores germinate in the respiratory tract, forming fungal plaques and granulomas.

## Symptoms

- Difficulty breathing, open-mouth breathing, tail bobbing
- Voice change or loss of vocalization
- Nasal discharge
- Lethargy and depression
- Weight loss and decreased appetite
- Exercise intolerance
- In advanced cases, cyanosis of the skin

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs, radiography (showing air sac opacities or lung lesions), endoscopy (direct visualization of fungal plaques), complete blood count (elevated white blood cells), and serum protein electrophoresis. Fungal culture from tracheal wash or biopsy samples can confirm the organism. Aspergillus antigen and antibody tests are available but have variable sensitivity.

## Treatment

Treatment is prolonged and challenging. Systemic antifungal medications include voriconazole (the current drug of choice), itraconazole, and amphotericin B. Nebulization with clotrimazole or terbinafine can deliver medication directly to the respiratory tract. Topical treatment via endoscopy may be used to debride visible plaques. Treatment duration typically ranges from weeks to months depending on severity. Supportive care including nutritional support and stress reduction is essential.

## Prevention

- Maintain clean, well-ventilated living environments
- Avoid moldy food, bedding, or nesting material
- Store food properly in cool, dry conditions
- Provide a balanced diet rich in vitamin A to support immune function
- Minimize stress from overcrowding, transport, or environmental changes
- Quarantine new birds before introducing them to the flock

## Prognosis

The prognosis for aspergillosis depends heavily on the stage at diagnosis. Early detection and treatment carry a fair to good prognosis. Chronic or disseminated aspergillosis has a guarded to poor prognosis, as extensive granulomatous lesions may be irreversible. Birds that respond to initial antifungal therapy may require long-term maintenance treatment to prevent relapse.
