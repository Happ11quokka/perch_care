# Pasteurella Infections

## Overview
Pasteurella infections in parrots are caused by *Pasteurella multocida* and related species, gram-negative bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity of cats and dogs. Pasteurellosis in pet birds is most frequently associated with cat bite or scratch injuries, making it one of the most urgent trauma-related bacterial infections encountered in avian medicine. The bacteria can cause rapidly progressive septicemia, and without immediate aggressive treatment, mortality rates are extremely high. Any bird attacked by a cat should be considered an emergency regardless of the apparent severity of visible wounds.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible to Pasteurella infections, with smaller species such as budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets being at greatest risk due to their vulnerability to cat attacks. Even larger parrots including conures, Amazon parrots, and African grey parrots can be victimized during out-of-cage time. Free-flighted birds and those housed in outdoor aviaries without adequate predator protection are at elevated risk. Birds with clipped wings that are unable to escape predator attacks are particularly vulnerable.

## Causes
*Pasteurella multocida* is a gram-negative coccobacillus that is part of the normal oral and upper respiratory flora of cats (present in approximately 70-90% of healthy cats) and many dogs. Transmission to birds occurs primarily through bite wounds, scratches, or even contact with cat saliva on feathers or skin. The bacteria are highly pathogenic to birds, and even minor scratches or puncture wounds can introduce sufficient organisms to cause fatal infection. Cat claws carry bacteria from grooming and litter box contact. The thin skin and hollow bones of birds provide minimal barrier to bacterial penetration, and air sacs can become contaminated through even small puncture wounds.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs can develop with alarming rapidity, often within hours of a cat attack. Initial signs include lethargy, fluffed feathers, and reluctance to move. As septicemia develops, birds become severely depressed, stop eating, and may show signs of shock including rapid breathing, tachycardia, and weakness. Visible bite or scratch wounds may be present, though feathers can conceal small puncture wounds. Subcutaneous emphysema from air sac rupture may be palpable. Infected wounds may show swelling, redness, and discharge. Without treatment, death can occur within 12-24 hours of the initial injury. Some birds appear initially stable after an attack but deteriorate rapidly as the infection progresses.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on a history of cat (or dog) contact combined with compatible clinical signs. Any bird presented after a known or suspected cat attack should be treated presumptively for Pasteurella infection even before culture results are available. Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing from wound sites or blood should be performed but should not delay initiation of treatment. Gram staining of wound aspirates may reveal gram-negative bipolar-staining coccobacilli. Radiographs help assess for air sac rupture, subcutaneous emphysema, and skeletal fractures. Complete blood count and biochemistry may show evidence of septicemia with heterophilia and toxic changes.

## Treatment
Treatment is a genuine emergency and must be initiated immediately. Broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against *Pasteurella multocida* should be started immediately upon presentation. First-line antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin), amoxicillin-clavulanate, and penicillin-based drugs. Aggressive parenteral fluid therapy is essential to combat shock and septicemia. Wound care includes thorough cleaning, debridement, and flushing. Analgesic medications should be provided for pain management. Anti-inflammatory drugs may be beneficial. Warm, quiet supportive housing is essential. Treatment with antibiotics should continue for a minimum of 7-10 days, and often longer. Birds that survive the initial 48 hours have an improved prognosis.

## Prevention
The most effective prevention is complete separation of cats and birds. Cats and birds should never have unsupervised contact, regardless of the cat's apparent temperament. Secure cage latches that cats cannot open. House birds in rooms that can be closed off from cats. Outdoor aviaries must have predator-proof construction with small mesh wire that prevents cat paws from reaching through. If an attack occurs, seek immediate veterinary care regardless of how minor the injuries appear. Even a single scratch from a cat claw should be treated as potentially life-threatening.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for Pasteurella infections in birds is guarded to poor, particularly if treatment is delayed even by several hours. Birds that receive immediate antibiotic therapy within the first few hours after a cat attack have the best chance of survival. Once septicemia is established, mortality rates are high despite aggressive treatment. Small birds with multiple puncture wounds carry a particularly grave prognosis. Birds that survive the initial 48-72 hours with appropriate treatment have a more favorable outlook for full recovery.
