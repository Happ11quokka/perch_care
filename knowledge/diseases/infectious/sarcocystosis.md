# Sarcocystosis

## Overview

Sarcocystosis is a severe and often fatal protozoal disease of parrots caused by *Sarcocystis falcatula* and related *Sarcocystis* species. The disease is characterized by acute onset of respiratory distress, pulmonary hemorrhage, and rapid death, particularly in Old World psittacine species. The parasite has an obligatory two-host life cycle involving an opossum (*Didelphis virginiana*) as the definitive host and various intermediate hosts. Cockroaches and other insects serve as transport hosts, carrying infective sporocysts from opossum feces to birds. Sarcocystosis is primarily a concern in the Americas where opossums are endemic, and represents one of the most devastating infectious diseases of captive Old World parrots housed in outdoor aviaries.

## Affected Species

Old World parrots are dramatically more susceptible than New World species. African Grey Parrots, cockatoos, Eclectus Parrots, and other Old World psittacines frequently die acutely from the disease. Interestingly, many New World parrot species (such as cockatiels) appear to be relatively resistant and can serve as intermediate hosts without developing severe clinical disease. This difference in susceptibility is thought to reflect evolutionary exposure, as New World species have co-evolved with the opossum-borne parasite.

## Causes

The life cycle of *Sarcocystis falcatula* involves the Virginia opossum as the definitive host, which sheds sporocysts in its feces. Cockroaches, beetles, and other insects ingest the sporocysts and serve as mechanical transport hosts. Parrots become infected by ingesting contaminated insects, food, or water that has been contaminated with opossum feces containing sporocysts. The parasite undergoes asexual reproduction (schizogony) in the bird's vascular endothelium, particularly in the lungs, causing massive vascular damage and hemorrhage.

## Symptoms

- Acute onset of severe respiratory distress
- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing) with open-mouth breathing
- Yellow discoloration of urates (suggesting liver involvement)
- Lethargy and weakness
- Anorexia
- Sudden death, often within 24 to 48 hours of onset
- Some birds found dead with no preceding clinical signs
- Pulmonary hemorrhage visible at necropsy

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is often made post-mortem due to the rapid and fatal course of the disease. Necropsy reveals pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Histopathology demonstrates schizonts (asexual reproductive stages) within vascular endothelial cells of the lungs, liver, and other organs. Ante-mortem diagnosis is challenging but may include blood smear evaluation for merozoites, PCR testing, and serology. Complete blood count may show anemia and heterophilia. Radiography may reveal diffuse pulmonary opacities.

## Treatment

There is no consistently effective treatment for acute sarcocystosis in Old World parrots, and the disease is frequently fatal despite intervention. Supportive care including oxygen therapy, fluid therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications may be attempted. Pyrimethamine combined with trimethoprim-sulfonamide has been used with limited success. Ponazuril (toltrazuril sulfone) is an antiprotozoal that has shown some promise in early or mild infections. The key focus must be on prevention, as treatment is rarely successful once clinical signs appear.

## Prevention

Prevention is the most critical aspect of managing sarcocystosis risk:
- Implement rigorous insect control programs (cockroach elimination is paramount)
- Exclude opossums from aviary areas with fencing and trapping
- Screen outdoor aviaries with fine mesh to prevent insect entry
- Store food in sealed containers to prevent insect and opossum contamination
- Remove fallen fruit and food waste that attract opossums and insects
- Clean food and water dishes daily
- Consider indoor housing for highly susceptible Old World species in endemic areas
- Avoid ground-level feeding in outdoor aviaries

## Prognosis

The prognosis for acute sarcocystosis in Old World parrots is very poor to grave. Mortality rates approach 100 percent in acutely affected Old World species. Birds that survive the acute phase may develop chronic sarcocystosis with cyst formation in muscles, but this is uncommon in psittacines. New World parrots have a significantly better prognosis if infected, as they may develop only mild or subclinical disease. Prevention remains far more effective than treatment for this devastating disease.
