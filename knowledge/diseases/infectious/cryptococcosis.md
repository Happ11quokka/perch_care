# Cryptococcosis

## Overview

Cryptococcosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by *Cryptococcus neoformans*, an encapsulated yeast found worldwide in the environment. The organism is strongly associated with pigeon and other avian droppings, where it can persist for years in dried fecal material. While pigeons themselves are typically resistant to infection due to their higher body temperature, pet parrots can develop clinical disease when exposed to contaminated environments. Cryptococcosis is considered rare in companion parrots but can cause serious respiratory and neurological disease when it does occur.

## Affected Species

All parrot species are potentially susceptible, although documented cases in pet parrots are uncommon. Immunocompromised birds or those exposed to environments heavily contaminated with pigeon droppings are at greatest risk. The disease has been reported in cockatoos, African Grey Parrots, and various other psittacine species in isolated case reports.

## Causes

Infection occurs through inhalation of *Cryptococcus neoformans* yeast cells or basidiospores from contaminated environments. Pigeon droppings are the primary environmental reservoir, particularly in urban settings. The fungus thrives in alkaline, nitrogen-rich substrates such as accumulated bird droppings, decaying wood, and soil. Predisposing factors in pet parrots include immunosuppression, concurrent illness, stress, malnutrition, and environmental exposure to wild bird feces.

## Symptoms

- Respiratory signs: nasal discharge, sneezing, dyspnea
- Neurological signs: head tilt, ataxia, circling, tremors, seizures
- Granulomatous masses in the upper respiratory tract or sinuses
- Swelling around the eyes or nares
- Weight loss and lethargy
- Diarrhea in cases with gastrointestinal involvement
- Skin nodules or lesions (rare)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is achieved through cytology of lesion aspirates revealing encapsulated yeast organisms. India ink staining highlights the characteristic large polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeast cells. Cryptococcal antigen testing (latex agglutination or lateral flow assay) on blood or cerebrospinal fluid is highly sensitive and specific. Fungal culture confirms the diagnosis. Radiography and CT imaging can identify respiratory granulomas or sinus involvement. Histopathology of biopsy samples shows characteristic granulomatous inflammation with encapsulated organisms.

## Treatment

Treatment of cryptococcosis in parrots is challenging and prolonged. Fluconazole is the most commonly used antifungal and penetrates the central nervous system effectively, making it appropriate for neurological involvement. Amphotericin B may be used in severe cases, often in combination with fluconazole. Itraconazole is an alternative option. Treatment duration is typically prolonged, often lasting several months, and should continue until clinical signs resolve and diagnostic tests are negative. Surgical debridement of accessible granulomas may be necessary.

## Prevention

- Prevent exposure to pigeon or wild bird droppings
- Keep aviaries clean and protected from wild bird contamination
- Avoid housing parrots near areas with accumulated pigeon feces
- Do not allow parrots access to outdoor areas contaminated with wild bird droppings
- Maintain optimal nutrition and minimize stress to support immune function
- Regular veterinary health checks for early detection

## Prognosis

The prognosis for cryptococcosis in parrots is guarded. Early detection and aggressive antifungal therapy may lead to resolution in some cases, but neurological involvement significantly worsens the prognosis. Disseminated disease is difficult to treat and often fatal. Due to the rarity of the disease in pet parrots, treatment protocols are largely extrapolated from mammalian medicine and case reports, and outcomes are variable.
