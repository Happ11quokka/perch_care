# Avian Influenza

## Overview
Avian influenza (AI) is a viral disease caused by type A influenza viruses that primarily affect birds. The disease ranges from low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI), which may cause mild or no clinical signs, to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which can cause rapid, severe systemic disease with very high mortality. Avian influenza is a reportable disease in most countries, meaning any suspected or confirmed case must be reported to veterinary authorities. While rare in pet parrots, the disease carries significant public health implications due to its zoonotic potential, particularly with certain H5 and H7 subtypes.

## Affected Species
All bird species are considered susceptible to avian influenza viruses, though susceptibility and disease severity vary greatly. Waterfowl (ducks, geese, swans) are the natural reservoir hosts and often carry LPAI viruses asymptomatically. Pet parrots are generally considered at low risk due to their indoor housing and limited contact with wild birds. However, psittacines are susceptible to infection and can develop severe disease, particularly with HPAI strains. Amazon parrots, budgerigars, cockatiels, and conures have been experimentally infected and shown to develop clinical disease. Parrots housed in outdoor aviaries in regions with active HPAI outbreaks in wild birds face elevated risk.

## Causes
Avian influenza viruses are type A influenza viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae. They are classified by their hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) surface glycoproteins, with 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes identified in birds. HPAI viruses are almost exclusively H5 and H7 subtypes. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected birds or their secretions (respiratory droplets, feces), and through contaminated water, equipment, and fomites. Wild migratory waterfowl are the primary reservoir, spreading the virus along flyways. Environmental contamination, particularly of water sources, is a significant factor. The virus can survive in water and moist environments for extended periods, particularly in cold conditions.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs vary with the pathogenicity of the virus strain. LPAI may cause mild respiratory signs (sneezing, coughing, nasal discharge), decreased egg production in breeding birds, and mild lethargy, or no signs at all. HPAI causes severe systemic disease with sudden death (often the first sign noted), severe depression, marked decrease in food and water consumption, respiratory distress, cyanosis of unfeathered skin, edema of the head and face, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and neurological signs including tremors, torticollis, paralysis, and incoordination. Mortality with HPAI can approach 100% in susceptible species within 48-72 hours of clinical onset.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation and must be coordinated with government veterinary authorities due to the reportable status of the disease. Virus isolation from oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs is the gold standard. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) provides rapid detection and subtyping. Rapid antigen detection tests are available but have lower sensitivity. Serology using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) or ELISA can detect antibodies but does not distinguish current from past infection. Post-mortem examination of HPAI cases may reveal hemorrhages throughout multiple organs, necrosis of internal organs, and congestion. Any suspicion of avian influenza, especially HPAI, must be immediately reported to appropriate veterinary authorities.

## Treatment
There is no specific approved treatment for avian influenza in birds. In the context of HPAI outbreaks, affected flocks are typically depopulated (culled) as part of governmental disease control programs. Supportive care may be attempted in individual pet birds with LPAI, including fluid therapy, nutritional support, and anti-inflammatory medications, but the focus is on containment and reporting. Antiviral drugs such as oseltamivir have been used experimentally but are generally not recommended for use in birds due to concerns about antiviral resistance development and the public health implications.

## Prevention
For pet parrot owners, the most important preventive measures include housing birds indoors, particularly during periods of active HPAI outbreaks in wild birds. Prevent contact between pet birds and wild birds or their droppings. Practice strict biosecurity: change shoes and clothing before handling pet birds if you have been in contact with other birds or poultry environments. Quarantine any new birds. Do not bring pet parrots to bird shows or markets during outbreak periods. Monitor government animal health advisories for information about local avian influenza activity. Ensure good ventilation but use screens to prevent wild bird access to enclosures.

## Prognosis
The prognosis depends entirely on the pathogenicity of the virus strain. LPAI infections in pet parrots may resolve with minimal intervention, and the prognosis is generally good. HPAI infections carry a grave prognosis, with mortality approaching 100% in susceptible species. Given the reportable nature and public health significance of the disease, individual bird treatment decisions must be made in consultation with veterinary and public health authorities. The overall risk to well-managed, indoor pet parrots remains low.
