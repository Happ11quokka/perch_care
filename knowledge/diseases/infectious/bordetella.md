# Bordetella Infections

## Overview
Bordetella infections in parrots are caused primarily by *Bordetella avium*, a gram-negative bacterium that targets the upper respiratory tract. While historically considered more significant in poultry (causing turkey coryza or bordetellosis), *Bordetella avium* and related species can cause upper respiratory infections in psittacine birds. The disease typically presents as rhinitis and tracheitis, with sneezing and nasal discharge as the predominant clinical signs. Though rarely fatal on its own, Bordetella can predispose birds to secondary bacterial or fungal infections.

## Affected Species
All parrot species can be affected by Bordetella infections, but cockatiels and budgerigars appear to be among the more commonly diagnosed. Young birds, recently weaned chicks, and newly acquired or transported birds are at highest risk due to the stress-related immunosuppression. Birds housed in crowded conditions, such as pet stores, breeding facilities, or bird fairs, are more likely to encounter the organism. Cockatoos and macaws have also been reported with clinical infections, particularly those housed in multi-bird environments.

## Causes
*Bordetella avium* is a gram-negative coccobacillus that has tropism for ciliated respiratory epithelium. The bacterium produces toxins and adhesins that damage the ciliated cells lining the trachea and nasal passages, impairing mucociliary clearance and predisposing to secondary infections. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected birds, aerosolized respiratory secretions, and contaminated fomites. Close proximity, poor ventilation, overcrowding, and environmental stressors facilitate spread. The organism can survive in the environment for variable periods, particularly on moist surfaces and in respiratory secretions.

## Symptoms
Upper respiratory signs predominate. Sneezing, often persistent and frequent, is typically the earliest clinical sign. Nasal discharge, initially clear and serous, may become mucopurulent as secondary bacterial infection develops. Birds may exhibit head shaking and rubbing of the nares against perches or cage bars. Mild conjunctivitis with watery or mucoid ocular discharge may occur. Decreased vocalization or voice changes can be noted due to tracheal inflammation. In most cases, birds remain alert and continue eating, though appetite may decrease slightly. Severe or prolonged infections can lead to sinusitis with infraorbital sinus swelling. Secondary bacterial or fungal infections, particularly aspergillosis, may develop due to compromised respiratory defenses.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on clinical signs combined with bacterial culture and sensitivity testing from nasal or choanal swabs. The organism can be identified on culture using selective media. PCR testing may be available for more rapid and specific detection. Gram staining of nasal discharge may reveal gram-negative coccobacilli, though this is not specific for Bordetella. Complete blood count may show mild heterophilia in complicated cases. Radiographs are usually unremarkable in uncomplicated upper respiratory infections but may be useful to rule out lower respiratory involvement. Endoscopic examination of the choanal and tracheal regions may reveal mucosal inflammation and excess mucus.

## Treatment
Antibiotic therapy guided by culture and sensitivity results is the foundation of treatment. Commonly effective antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin), doxycycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Treatment duration is typically 10-14 days or until clinical signs have fully resolved. Nebulization therapy with saline or appropriate antibiotics can help hydrate airways and deliver medication directly to the respiratory mucosa. Nasal flushing with sterile saline may provide symptomatic relief for birds with significant nasal discharge. Supportive care including maintaining appropriate humidity, minimizing environmental stressors, and ensuring adequate nutrition supports recovery.

## Prevention
Quarantine all new birds for a minimum of 30 days before introducing them to existing birds. Maintain adequate ventilation in bird housing areas while avoiding drafts. Avoid overcrowding and minimize stress during transportation and relocation. Practice good hygiene with regular cleaning and disinfection of enclosures and equipment. Isolate birds showing respiratory signs immediately to prevent spread. Ensure optimal nutrition with adequate vitamin A to maintain healthy respiratory epithelium. Minimize exposure to potential sources of infection at bird shows, fairs, and pet stores.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for uncomplicated Bordetella infections is generally good with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Most birds recover fully within 2-3 weeks of initiating treatment. However, the prognosis becomes more guarded if secondary infections (particularly aspergillosis) develop, or if the bird has concurrent immunosuppressive conditions. Chronic sinusitis may require more prolonged treatment and occasional sinus flushing. Full recovery is expected in most cases when treatment is initiated promptly and predisposing factors are addressed.
