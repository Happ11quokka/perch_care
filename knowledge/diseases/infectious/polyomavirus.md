# Avian Polyomavirus

## Overview
Avian Polyomavirus (APV) is a highly significant viral disease that primarily causes acute fatal infections in young psittacine birds, particularly budgerigars, where the disease was originally known as "budgerigar fledgling disease." The virus belongs to the family Polyomaviridae and can cause devastating losses in breeding facilities. While young birds are most severely affected, adult birds can become asymptomatic carriers that shed the virus intermittently. A vaccine is available and is an important tool for prevention in breeding collections.

## Affected Species
Budgerigars are the most classically and severely affected species, with fledgling mortality rates that can exceed 30% in affected aviaries. However, APV has been documented in a wide range of psittacine species including macaws, conures, Eclectus parrots, ring-necked parakeets, caiques, and lovebirds. Non-budgerigar psittacines typically develop a different clinical presentation compared to budgerigars. Cockatoos and African grey parrots appear to be somewhat more resistant, though infections have been documented. The disease is also recognized in some non-psittacine species including finches.

## Causes
Avian Polyomavirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. Like other non-enveloped viruses, APV is highly resistant to environmental degradation and many common disinfectants. The virus is shed in feces, feather dander, respiratory secretions, and crop secretions of infected birds. Transmission occurs through direct contact, inhalation of contaminated dust and dander, ingestion of contaminated material, and contact with fomites. Vertical transmission from infected hens has been documented. Adult carrier birds may shed the virus intermittently, particularly during periods of stress, breeding activity, or concurrent illness, making them a persistent reservoir of infection within aviaries.

## Symptoms
In budgerigars, the classic presentation is sudden death in nestlings between 10-25 days of age. Affected chicks may show abdominal distension, subcutaneous hemorrhages (visible through the thin skin as bruising), decreased crop emptying, and tremors before death. Feather abnormalities including lack of contour feather development ("French moult" appearance, though true French moult is caused by BFDV) may be seen in survivors. In non-budgerigar psittacines, young birds (typically under 14 weeks) may develop acute lethargy, anorexia, regurgitation, diarrhea, polyuria, dehydration, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and rapid death. Delayed crop emptying and weight loss are common. Adult non-budgerigar psittacines are typically asymptomatic carriers, though some may develop feather abnormalities.

## Diagnosis
PCR testing of cloacal and choanal swabs, blood, or tissue samples is the primary diagnostic method. Since shedding can be intermittent, multiple tests may be needed to detect carrier birds. Serology (hemagglutination inhibition) can detect antibody levels, with high titers suggesting recent exposure or active infection. Viral DNA detection by PCR in feather follicle samples can identify carriers. In deceased birds, histopathology of liver, kidney, and spleen reveals characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies (karyomegaly). Gross post-mortem findings include hepatomegaly with pale or mottled liver, splenomegaly, and hemorrhages in multiple organs.

## Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment for avian polyomavirus. Management is entirely supportive and includes fluid therapy, nutritional support, heat supplementation, and treatment of secondary infections. Most young birds with acute clinical disease do not survive despite supportive care. Adult birds that are identified as carriers generally do not require treatment, as they typically remain clinically healthy. The focus should be on preventing transmission to susceptible young birds through management and vaccination strategies.

## Prevention
Vaccination is the cornerstone of polyomavirus prevention in breeding facilities. The killed vaccine is administered to breeding birds and young psittacines according to the manufacturer's protocol, typically involving two doses given 2-4 weeks apart. Quarantine and PCR testing of all new birds before introduction to existing collections is essential. Strict hygiene and biosecurity measures should be implemented, particularly during breeding season. Separate hand-feeding equipment for each clutch prevents cross-contamination. Effective disinfectants include 10% bleach and glutaraldehyde-based products. Minimizing stress in breeding birds reduces intermittent viral shedding.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for young birds with acute clinical polyomavirus infection is poor to grave, with mortality rates often exceeding 50% in affected nestlings. Budgerigar fledglings that survive may recover but can have permanent feather abnormalities. Adult birds that seroconvert and clear the virus have a good prognosis for long-term health, though some may remain intermittent shedders. In non-budgerigar psittacines, older chicks and adults that survive exposure typically develop immunity and do well long-term. Proper vaccination programs have dramatically reduced losses in well-managed breeding facilities.
