# Coccidiosis

## Overview

Coccidiosis is a gastrointestinal parasitic disease caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genera *Isospora* and *Eimeria*, belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. These single-celled organisms invade and destroy the epithelial cells lining the intestinal tract, causing inflammation, malabsorption, and diarrhea. The parasites have a direct life cycle involving both sexual and asexual reproductive stages within the host, producing resistant oocysts that are shed in feces and become infective after a period of sporulation in the environment. While coccidiosis is more common in poultry and aviary birds, it can also affect pet parrots.

## Affected Species

Cockatiel, budgerigars, lovebirds, and other small parrots can be affected. *Isospora* species are more commonly reported in psittacines, while *Eimeria* species are predominantly seen in poultry and gallinaceous birds. Young birds, recently stressed birds, and those with compromised immune systems are most susceptible to clinical disease. Many adult birds may carry low levels of coccidia without showing clinical signs.

## Causes

Coccidiosis is transmitted through the fecal-oral route by ingestion of sporulated oocysts from contaminated food, water, bedding, or cage surfaces. Oocysts are extremely resistant in the environment and can persist for months. Sporulation (the process by which oocysts become infective) requires warmth, moisture, and oxygen, typically occurring within one to two days after being shed. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, stress, concurrent illness, and immunosuppression promote clinical outbreaks. Damp environments accelerate oocyst sporulation.

## Symptoms

- Diarrhea, which may be watery, mucoid, or bloody
- Weight loss and poor growth (especially in young birds)
- Decreased appetite
- Fluffed feathers and lethargy
- Dehydration
- Abdominal discomfort
- In severe cases, death (particularly in young or immunocompromised birds)

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is made by fecal flotation examination, which detects oocysts in droppings. Standard zinc sulfate or sugar flotation techniques are used. Oocysts are oval to round structures with characteristic internal structures after sporulation. Direct fecal smears may reveal oocysts but are less sensitive than flotation. Quantification of oocyst numbers can help assess the severity of infection. Histopathology of intestinal tissue reveals intracellular developmental stages of the parasite within epithelial cells. It is important to differentiate pathogenic coccidia from non-pathogenic species.

## Treatment

Trimethoprim-sulfonamide combinations (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) are the most commonly used treatment in pet birds. Toltrazuril is an effective anticoccidial medication used in some countries. Sulfonamides alone (sulfadimethoxine) can also be used. Treatment is typically administered for 5 to 7 days. Amprolium is used in poultry but less commonly in companion birds. Supportive care including fluid therapy and nutritional support is essential for debilitated birds. Environmental decontamination is critical, as oocysts are resistant to many common disinfectants. Ammonia-based disinfectants and high-temperature steam cleaning are most effective.

## Prevention

- Maintain strict cage hygiene with daily removal of droppings
- Clean and disinfect food and water containers daily
- Keep cage environments dry, as moisture promotes oocyst sporulation
- Avoid overcrowding in aviaries and breeding facilities
- Quarantine new birds and perform fecal testing
- Provide clean, elevated food and water sources to prevent fecal contamination
- Minimize stress during breeding, weaning, and transport

## Prognosis

The prognosis for coccidiosis is generally good with appropriate treatment and environmental management. Mild infections in healthy adult birds may resolve with minimal intervention. Severe infections in young, immunocompromised, or heavily parasitized birds carry a guarded prognosis. Reinfection is common if environmental contamination is not adequately addressed. Development of partial immunity may occur in birds with previous exposure.
