# Trichomoniasis (Canker)

## Overview

Trichomoniasis, commonly known as "canker," is a protozoal infection caused by *Trichomonas gallinae*, a flagellated protozoan parasite that infects the upper digestive tract of birds. The organism primarily colonizes the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and crop, causing necrotic, caseous (cheese-like) plaques and lesions. Trichomoniasis is one of the most common protozoal diseases in birds, well-known in pigeons and raptors, and also occurs in pet parrots. The parasite is fragile in the environment and cannot form cysts, so transmission requires relatively direct contact.

## Affected Species

Budgerigars, cockatiels, and other small parrots are susceptible. Pigeons and doves are the most commonly affected birds overall and serve as a natural reservoir. Raptors that consume infected pigeons are also at high risk. Young birds and immunocompromised individuals are most likely to develop severe clinical disease. Parent birds can transmit the parasite to chicks during feeding.

## Causes

*Trichomonas gallinae* is transmitted through direct contact, shared food and water sources, and parent-to-chick feeding. The organism cannot survive long in the environment because it does not form resistant cysts. Contaminated drinking water is a major route of transmission, particularly in aviary settings where multiple birds share water sources. Stress, overcrowding, poor nutrition, and concurrent illness predispose birds to clinical disease. Some birds may carry the organism subclinically, shedding trophozoites without showing signs.

## Symptoms

- Yellow-white caseous (cheese-like) plaques in the mouth, throat, and crop
- Difficulty swallowing
- Regurgitation and drooling
- Decreased appetite or reluctance to eat
- Weight loss
- Foul-smelling breath
- Labored breathing if lesions obstruct the airway
- Swelling of the throat or neck region
- In severe cases, erosion through the palate or esophageal wall

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is made by wet mount microscopy of swabs taken from oral or crop lesions. Fresh samples examined immediately under the microscope reveal motile, pear-shaped trophozoites with characteristic undulating membranes and flagella. The organisms die quickly once removed from the host, so samples must be examined promptly. Culture in specialized media (such as InPouch or Diamond media) can increase diagnostic sensitivity. Histopathology of biopsied lesions reveals necrotic tissue with organisms. PCR testing is available for confirmation.

## Treatment

Metronidazole is the traditional treatment of choice for trichomoniasis, administered orally for 5 to 10 days. Ronidazole is an alternative that may be more effective and has fewer side effects in some species. Carnidazole (single-dose treatment) is used in some countries. Physical removal of large caseous plaques under anesthesia may be necessary in severe cases to relieve airway obstruction. Supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support (tube feeding if the bird cannot eat), and treatment of secondary bacterial infections is important. All in-contact birds should be treated simultaneously.

## Prevention

- Provide fresh, clean water daily and clean water containers frequently
- Avoid shared water sources between different bird species
- Quarantine new birds and screen for trichomonads before introduction
- Prevent contact with pigeons and doves, which serve as reservoirs
- Maintain good hygiene in aviaries and breeding facilities
- Ensure proper nutrition to support immune function

## Prognosis

The prognosis is good for mild to moderate cases treated early with appropriate antiprotozoal medication. Most birds respond well to metronidazole or ronidazole therapy. Severe cases with extensive caseous lesions, airway obstruction, or systemic involvement carry a guarded prognosis. Young chicks with trichomoniasis may have a poorer outcome due to their limited reserves and difficulty maintaining hydration and nutrition during treatment.
