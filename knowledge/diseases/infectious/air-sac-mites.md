# Air Sac Mites (Sternostoma tracheacolum)

## Overview

Air sac mite infestation is a respiratory parasitic disease caused by *Sternostoma tracheacolum*, a small internal mite that inhabits the trachea, lungs, air sacs, and other parts of the respiratory tract of birds. The mites are tiny (approximately 0.5-0.7 mm), making them invisible to the naked eye, and they burrow into and feed on the mucosal lining of the respiratory tract. Air sac mites cause significant irritation, inflammation, and mucus production, leading to respiratory distress. The condition is most commonly associated with finches and canaries but can also affect small parrots. Heavy infestations can be fatal if left untreated.

## Affected Species

Gouldian finches, canaries, and other finch species are the most commonly and severely affected birds. Among parrots, small species such as budgerigars, parrotlets, and lovebirds can be affected, though less frequently than finches. Larger parrots are rarely affected. Gouldian finches are particularly susceptible and air sac mite infestation is one of the most significant health concerns in this species.

## Causes

*Sternostoma tracheacolum* has a direct life cycle completed entirely on the host bird. The mites are transmitted through close contact between birds, particularly from parent birds to chicks during feeding. The mites may also transfer during close perching or through respiratory droplets. Adult female mites are viviparous, giving birth to live larvae within the respiratory tract of the host. The entire life cycle takes approximately two to three weeks. Stress, overcrowding, poor ventilation, malnutrition, and concurrent illness increase susceptibility to clinical disease.

## Symptoms

- Clicking, wheezing, or squeaking respiratory sounds
- Open-mouth breathing
- Tail bobbing (indicating respiratory effort)
- Loss of voice or change in vocalization (particularly notable in singing species)
- Sneezing and nasal discharge
- Head shaking
- Decreased activity and exercise intolerance
- Weight loss
- Sudden death in severe infestations

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis can be challenging because the mites are too small to see without magnification. Transillumination of the trachea (shining a bright light through the throat area in small birds) may reveal dark spots representing mites within the trachea, particularly in small, light-skinned finches. This technique is less reliable in parrots with thicker skin. Tracheal swab or wash with microscopic examination can identify mites or eggs. Endoscopy of the trachea and air sacs allows direct visualization. Post-mortem examination of the respiratory tract reveals mites. A presumptive diagnosis is often made based on clinical signs and response to treatment.

## Treatment

Ivermectin is the treatment of choice, administered either topically (a single drop on bare skin, usually the back of the neck or over the jugular vein) or orally. Treatment is typically repeated every 10 to 14 days for three treatments to cover all life stages of the mite. Moxidectin spot-on formulations are also effective. All birds in contact with the affected individual should be treated simultaneously, even if asymptomatic, as subclinical carriers are common. Supportive care including placement in a warm, humid environment may help with respiratory distress during treatment. Secondary bacterial respiratory infections should be treated with appropriate antibiotics.

## Prevention

- Quarantine and treat new birds before introduction to existing flocks
- Maintain good ventilation in housing areas
- Avoid overcrowding
- Regular health screening, especially for finches and small parrots
- Prophylactic ivermectin treatment of new acquisitions
- Keep breeding pairs free of mites to prevent transmission to chicks
- Minimize stress and maintain optimal nutrition

## Prognosis

The prognosis is good if diagnosed and treated early. Most birds respond well to ivermectin or moxidectin therapy, and respiratory signs improve within days of treatment. Severe, chronic infestations with extensive respiratory tract damage carry a more guarded prognosis, as permanent changes to the respiratory mucosa may persist. Secondary bacterial infections can complicate recovery. Without treatment, heavy infestations can be fatal, particularly in Gouldian finches and other small, delicate species.
