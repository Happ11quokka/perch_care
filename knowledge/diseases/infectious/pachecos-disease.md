# Pacheco's Disease (Psittacid Herpesvirus)

## Overview
Pacheco's disease is an acute, highly fatal viral infection of parrots caused by Psittacid Herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), a member of the family Herpesviridae. The disease was first described by Genesio Pacheco in 1930 and is characterized by acute hepatic necrosis leading to sudden death, often with few or no premonitory signs. Pacheco's disease is one of the most feared infectious diseases in aviculture due to its rapid onset, high mortality rate, and the potential for asymptomatic carrier birds to trigger outbreaks when stressed. A vaccine is available for at-risk populations.

## Affected Species
All psittacine species are susceptible, but susceptibility and clinical presentation vary considerably between species. Amazons, macaws, cockatoos, and conures are among the most commonly affected with clinical disease. Certain species, particularly Patagonian conures and nanday conures, are recognized as common asymptomatic carriers that can shed the virus and trigger outbreaks in susceptible species. African grey parrots and budgerigars also appear to be relatively susceptible to clinical disease. Multiple serotypes of PsHV-1 exist, and different serotypes may show varying pathogenicity across species.

## Causes
Psittacid Herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1) is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. Like all herpesviruses, PsHV-1 establishes latent infections in recovered or carrier birds, with the virus residing in nerve ganglia. Reactivation and shedding can occur during periods of stress such as transportation, new environment introduction, breeding, illness, or overcrowding. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected birds and through ingestion of feces, nasal secretions, or contaminated food and water. The virus can also be transmitted through fomites. The incubation period is typically 3-14 days. Because carrier birds appear clinically normal, they represent a significant epidemiological challenge in aviculture.

## Symptoms
The hallmark of Pacheco's disease is sudden death with minimal premonitory signs. Birds may be found dead without any prior indication of illness. When clinical signs are observed, they typically include acute lethargy, anorexia, ruffled feathers, and depression that progresses rapidly over 24-48 hours. Yellow-green diarrhea (reflecting liver damage and biliverdinuria) is a characteristic finding. Regurgitation may occur. Some birds develop sinusitis or conjunctivitis. Neurological signs including tremors and convulsions have been reported in some cases. In outbreaks, multiple birds may die in rapid succession. Occasionally, birds survive the acute phase and develop chronic hepatitis or papillomatous lesions in the gastrointestinal tract (cloacal papillomas), which are associated with certain PsHV-1 serotypes.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often presumptive based on the clinical scenario of sudden deaths in a collection with characteristic post-mortem findings. Post-mortem examination reveals hepatomegaly with pale, mottled, or hemorrhagic liver. Splenomegaly and hemorrhages in other organs may also be present. Histopathology shows hepatic necrosis with characteristic eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Cowdry type A inclusions) in hepatocytes. PCR testing can detect viral DNA in liver tissue, cloacal swabs, or blood and is useful for identifying carrier birds. Viral isolation from tissue samples can provide definitive diagnosis. Serology is available but may not detect latently infected carriers. In living birds, elevated liver enzymes (AST, LDH) and bile acids suggest hepatic involvement.

## Treatment
Treatment is challenging due to the rapid clinical course. Acyclovir, an antiviral drug, has been used with variable success and must be initiated very early in the disease course to be effective. Dosing protocols vary, but oral administration of 80 mg/kg three times daily has been reported. Aggressive supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support, thermal support, and hepatoprotective agents is essential. Treatment of secondary bacterial infections may be necessary. In outbreak situations, all exposed birds should be treated prophylactically with acyclovir. The prognosis for clinically affected birds remains guarded despite treatment.

## Prevention
Vaccination with a killed PsHV-1 vaccine is available and recommended for birds in collections at risk, such as breeding facilities and multi-bird households, particularly those that include known carrier species. Quarantine all new birds for a minimum of 30-60 days with appropriate monitoring before introduction. PCR testing of new arrivals, especially conure species, can help identify carriers. Minimize stress in collections, as stress triggers viral reactivation and shedding from carriers. Maintain excellent biosecurity with species separation when possible, particularly isolating known carrier species from susceptible species.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for Pacheco's disease is poor to grave. Untreated, mortality rates can approach 100% in susceptible species. Early intervention with acyclovir may improve survival in some cases, but the rapid clinical course often precludes effective treatment. Birds that survive may become latent carriers with the potential for future reactivation and shedding. In outbreak situations, rapid implementation of acyclovir therapy for all exposed birds and environmental decontamination can reduce overall mortality. Long-term survivors should be monitored for development of cloacal papillomas and chronic hepatitis.
