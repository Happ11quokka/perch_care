# Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) / Avian Bornavirus

## Overview
Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD), also known as macaw wasting disease, is a devastating neurological and gastrointestinal disease of parrots caused by Avian Bornavirus (ABV). The disease is characterized by lymphoplasmacytic ganglioneuritis, an inflammatory destruction of nerve ganglia throughout the body, most notably affecting the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. PDD was first recognized in macaws in the late 1970s, and the causal association with Avian Bornavirus was established in 2008. There is no cure, and the disease remains one of the most feared diagnoses in avian medicine.

## Affected Species
All psittacine species are susceptible to PDD. Macaws (particularly blue-and-gold, scarlet, and military macaws) were the first species recognized with the disease and remain commonly affected. African grey parrots, cockatoos, Amazon parrots, conures, and Eclectus parrots are also frequently diagnosed. The disease has been documented in over 80 psittacine species. Some species may carry ABV without developing clinical disease, serving as subclinical reservoirs. The disease appears to affect birds of any age, though it is most commonly diagnosed in young to middle-aged adults.

## Causes
Avian Bornavirus (ABV), a member of the family Bornaviridae, is the causative agent. Multiple genotypes of ABV (designated ABV-1 through ABV-8 and beyond) have been identified, with varying pathogenicity. The virus targets nervous tissue and induces an immune-mediated inflammatory response (lymphoplasmacytic ganglioneuritis) that destroys nerve ganglia. Transmission is believed to occur through the fecal-oral route and possibly via inhalation of virus-containing aerosolized material. Vertical transmission from hen to chick through the egg has been documented. The incubation period is highly variable, ranging from weeks to years, making epidemiological tracking extremely difficult. Not all birds infected with ABV develop clinical PDD, suggesting that host immune response plays a critical role in disease development.

## Symptoms
Gastrointestinal signs are the most common and result from impaired motility due to destruction of enteric nerve ganglia. Birds develop proventricular dilation with impaired gastric motility, leading to regurgitation, passage of undigested food (whole seeds) in droppings, chronic weight loss despite a maintained or increased appetite, and progressive wasting. Crop stasis may occur. Neurological signs include ataxia, tremors, seizures, proprioceptive deficits, blindness, and abnormal head movements. Some birds present predominantly with neurological signs without obvious gastrointestinal involvement. Less commonly, cardiac arrhythmias, adrenal dysfunction, and other organ involvement may occur due to widespread ganglioneuritis.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be challenging, as no single test is definitive in living birds. PCR testing of choanal and cloacal swabs, blood, or feather calami can detect ABV RNA, though intermittent shedding may lead to false negatives. Serology (indirect fluorescent antibody or ELISA) can detect anti-ABV antibodies, but positive results indicate exposure rather than necessarily clinical disease. Radiographs and fluoroscopy may reveal proventricular dilation and impaired gastric motility. Contrast radiography (barium series) can demonstrate delayed gastrointestinal transit and proventricular distension. The definitive diagnosis requires histopathological examination of crop, proventricular, or other tissue biopsies showing characteristic lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of nerve ganglia. Crop biopsy has been used as an antemortem diagnostic tool, though sensitivity varies.

## Treatment
There is no cure for PDD. Treatment is palliative and supportive, aimed at managing symptoms and maintaining quality of life. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), particularly celecoxib and meloxicam, have shown benefit in reducing the inflammatory ganglioneuritis and improving clinical signs in some birds. Dietary management is important; easily digestible diets (pellets, soft foods) may reduce the burden on the compromised gastrointestinal tract. Prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide may improve gastric motility. Supportive care including nutritional supplementation, weight monitoring, and treatment of secondary infections is essential. Some birds stabilize on long-term NSAID therapy and maintain a reasonable quality of life for months to years.

## Prevention
Quarantine and test all new birds with PCR and serology before introduction to existing flocks. Maintain strict biosecurity in aviculture collections. Separate ABV-positive birds from uninfected birds. Minimize stress, as stress may contribute to disease development in infected birds. There is currently no vaccine available. Environmental hygiene with thorough cleaning and disinfection helps reduce viral load, though ABV is an enveloped virus and is susceptible to most common disinfectants. Breeding programs should test parent birds and avoid breeding ABV-positive individuals when possible.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for birds with clinical PDD is guarded to poor. The disease is ultimately progressive in most cases, though the rate of decline is highly variable. Some birds may survive months to years with palliative care, particularly those that respond to NSAID therapy. Birds with primarily neurological signs may deteriorate more rapidly. Spontaneous resolution has been rarely reported. Birds that test positive for ABV without clinical signs may never develop disease, or may develop signs months to years later. The unpredictable nature of the disease makes prognostication challenging.
