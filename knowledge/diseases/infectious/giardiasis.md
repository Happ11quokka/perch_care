# Giardiasis

## Overview

Giardiasis is a protozoal infection caused by *Giardia psittaci* (also referred to as *Giardia* species), a flagellated protozoan parasite that colonizes the small intestine of parrots. The parasite exists in two forms: the motile trophozoite, which attaches to the intestinal lining and causes damage, and the environmentally resistant cyst, which is shed in feces and serves as the infectious stage. Giardiasis causes chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and wasting, and is a significant health concern in cockatiels and other companion parrots. The disease can be challenging to diagnose and treat due to intermittent cyst shedding.

## Affected Species

Cockatiels are the most commonly and characteristically affected species, with a particularly high prevalence reported in this species. Budgerigars, lovebirds, and other small to medium parrots are also susceptible. The disease has been documented in many psittacine species, but cockatiels appear to have a unique susceptibility, with some populations showing high carrier rates.

## Causes

Giardiasis is transmitted via the fecal-oral route through ingestion of infective cysts from contaminated food, water, or environmental surfaces. The cysts are highly resistant in the environment, surviving for weeks to months in cool, moist conditions. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, contaminated water sources, and stress facilitate transmission. Birds can become reinfected from contaminated cage surfaces, perches, and water bowls.

## Symptoms

- Chronic, loose, or mucoid diarrhea
- Malodorous droppings
- Weight loss despite adequate food intake
- Dry, flaky, itchy skin (particularly notable in cockatiels)
- Excessive feather picking or self-mutilation (potentially linked to skin irritation)
- Bulky, pale, or greasy droppings (steatorrhea)
- Lethargy and depression
- Poor feather condition

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis can be challenging due to intermittent cyst shedding. Direct fecal smear examination may reveal motile trophozoites in fresh, watery feces. Zinc sulfate fecal flotation is the preferred technique for detecting cysts. Multiple fecal samples collected over several days increase diagnostic sensitivity. ELISA-based antigen tests designed for detecting *Giardia* in mammalian species may have cross-reactivity with avian *Giardia*. PCR testing offers higher sensitivity. Trichrome staining of fecal smears can help identify organisms.

## Treatment

Metronidazole is the most commonly prescribed treatment for avian giardiasis, typically administered orally for 5 to 10 days. Ronidazole is an alternative that may be more effective in some cases. Fenbendazole has also been used with variable success. Environmental decontamination is critical to prevent reinfection: all cages, perches, food dishes, and water containers must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected with dilute bleach or quaternary ammonium compounds. The environment should be kept dry, as *Giardia* cysts thrive in moisture. Repeat treatment courses may be necessary.

## Prevention

- Maintain strict cage hygiene with daily cleaning of food and water dishes
- Remove droppings promptly and disinfect cage surfaces regularly
- Provide fresh, clean water daily (avoid open water sources)
- Quarantine and test new birds before introduction
- Avoid overcrowding
- Keep the environment dry and well-ventilated
- Screen cockatiels and other susceptible species regularly

## Prognosis

The prognosis for giardiasis is generally good with appropriate treatment and environmental management. However, reinfection is common if environmental decontamination is inadequate. Some birds become chronic carriers, shedding cysts intermittently and serving as a source of infection. The association between giardiasis and feather-picking behavior in cockatiels may persist even after parasitological cure, suggesting that chronic infection may trigger lasting behavioral changes.
