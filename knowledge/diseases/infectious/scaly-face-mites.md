# Scaly Face Mites (Knemidocoptes)

## Overview

Scaly face mite infestation is a parasitic skin condition caused by *Knemidocoptes pilae* (also spelled *Cnemidocoptes*), a burrowing mite that tunnels into the superficial layers of the skin. The mites primarily affect the cere (fleshy area above the beak), beak, eyelids, and legs of affected birds, creating characteristic honeycomb-like crusty proliferations. The condition is sometimes called "scaly face and leg disease" or "tassel foot" when the legs are involved. The mites complete their entire life cycle on the host bird, burrowing into the epidermis where they feed and reproduce.

## Affected Species

Budgerigars (parakeets) are the most commonly and severely affected species. The condition also occurs in other small parrots including kakarikis, parrotlets, and lovebirds. Larger parrots are uncommonly affected. Canaries and finches can be infested by the closely related species *Knemidocoptes mutans* (scaly leg mite). An underlying immunodeficiency or genetic predisposition is suspected in budgerigars that develop clinical disease, as not all exposed birds become symptomatic.

## Causes

The mite *Knemidocoptes pilae* is transmitted through direct contact between birds, most commonly from parent to chick during feeding and brooding. The mites can survive off the host for short periods but require a host to complete their life cycle. Immunosuppression, stress, malnutrition, and concurrent illness predispose birds to clinical infestation. Some birds may carry low numbers of mites without showing clinical signs, only developing visible lesions when their immune system is compromised.

## Symptoms

- White to gray crusty, honeycomb-like proliferations on the cere and beak
- Crusty lesions around the eyes and corners of the mouth
- Scaly, thickened skin on the legs and feet
- Beak deformity in advanced cases (overgrowth, malformation)
- Mild to moderate pruritus (itching)
- In severe cases, loss of toes from constriction by crusty deposits
- Secondary bacterial infections of damaged skin

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is usually based on the characteristic clinical appearance of the crusty lesions, particularly in budgerigars. Skin scrapings from affected areas examined under a microscope reveal the round, burrowing mites with short, stubby legs. The mites are very small (approximately 300-500 micrometers) and may require oil immersion microscopy for clear visualization. Biopsy of affected tissue shows mites within burrows in the hyperkeratotic epidermis.

## Treatment

Ivermectin is the treatment of choice, administered either topically (applied to bare skin, typically on the back of the neck) or by injection. A single drop of diluted ivermectin applied to the skin is typically repeated every 10 to 14 days for three to four treatments to ensure all life stages of the mite are eliminated. Moxidectin spot-on formulations are also effective. Crusty lesions gradually resolve over several weeks following successful treatment as normal skin regenerates. Do not attempt to manually remove crusts, as this can cause bleeding and pain. The environment should be thoroughly cleaned during treatment.

## Prevention

- Quarantine and examine new birds before adding them to a collection
- Avoid purchasing birds with visible crusty lesions
- Maintain good hygiene and nutrition to support immune function
- Regular veterinary examinations to detect early infestations
- Treat all in-contact birds if one bird is diagnosed
- Clean and disinfect cages and perches during treatment

## Prognosis

The prognosis for scaly face mites is excellent with appropriate treatment. Most birds respond well to ivermectin therapy, and lesions resolve completely within weeks to months. Early-stage cases without beak deformity recover fully. Advanced cases with significant beak deformity may have permanent structural changes even after the mites are eliminated. Rarely, severely deformed beaks may require ongoing trimming.
