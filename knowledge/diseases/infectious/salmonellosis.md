# Salmonellosis

## Overview
Salmonellosis is a bacterial infection caused by various species of the genus *Salmonella*, with *Salmonella typhimurium* being the most commonly isolated serovar in pet parrots. It is a significant zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from birds to humans and vice versa. The disease ranges in severity from asymptomatic carriage to acute fatal septicemia, and it is a particular concern in aviculture due to its potential for rapid spread within flocks.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible to *Salmonella* infections. Lorikeets and lories, which consume nectar-based diets that promote bacterial growth, may be at increased risk. Young birds and neonates are especially vulnerable to severe disease. Amazon parrots, African grey parrots, cockatoos, and budgerigars are commonly reported with clinical salmonellosis. Birds housed in outdoor aviaries with exposure to wild bird droppings, rodents, or contaminated water sources face elevated risk.

## Causes
*Salmonella* species are gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route via contaminated food, water, or environmental surfaces. Wild birds, rodents, and insects serve as reservoirs and vectors. Contaminated raw vegetables, sprouted seeds, and unpasteurized foods are potential sources. Vertical transmission through infected eggs can occur. Stress, overcrowding, poor hygiene, immunosuppression, and concurrent infections increase susceptibility. The bacteria can survive in the environment for extended periods, particularly in moist conditions.

## Symptoms
Clinical presentations vary widely. Acute infection may cause severe depression, fluffed feathers, anorexia, and watery or bloody diarrhea. Birds may develop crop stasis, regurgitation, and dehydration. Septicemia can lead to rapid decline and death within 24-48 hours. Chronic infections may manifest as intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, and poor condition. Some birds become asymptomatic carriers that shed organisms intermittently, particularly during periods of stress. Joint swelling (arthritis), neurological signs, and conjunctivitis have also been reported. In breeding birds, decreased fertility, embryonic death, and nestling mortality are common.

## Diagnosis
Bacterial culture of fresh fecal samples or cloacal swabs is the primary diagnostic method. Multiple cultures may be necessary, as shedding can be intermittent in carrier birds. Enrichment culture techniques improve detection sensitivity. PCR testing offers faster and more sensitive detection. Blood cultures are indicated in suspected septicemia. Hematology may reveal heterophilia, anemia, and toxic changes in white blood cells. Serotyping of isolated organisms helps in epidemiological investigations. Post-mortem findings typically include enlarged liver and spleen with multiple small necrotic foci.

## Treatment
Antibiotic therapy should be guided by culture and sensitivity results. Commonly used antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Treatment duration is typically 3-6 weeks to reduce the risk of carrier states developing. Aggressive supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support, and thermal support is essential for severely affected birds. Follow-up cultures after completing treatment are recommended to confirm elimination of the organism. It is important to note that antibiotic treatment may not fully eliminate carriage in all cases.

## Prevention
Maintain rigorous hygiene including daily cleaning and disinfection of food and water containers. Prevent exposure to wild birds, rodents, and their droppings. Properly clean and disinfect all fresh food items before feeding. Avoid feeding raw or undercooked animal products. Quarantine new birds with appropriate testing before introduction. Implement pest control programs to reduce rodent and insect vectors. Educate owners about the zoonotic risk and the importance of handwashing after handling birds or cleaning enclosures.

## Prognosis
The prognosis varies with the severity of infection and promptness of treatment. Mild gastrointestinal infections generally respond well to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Acute septicemia carries a guarded to poor prognosis, especially in young or debilitated birds. Chronic carrier states can be difficult to eliminate entirely, posing ongoing risk to other birds and humans. Complete recovery is possible with early intervention and correction of predisposing factors.
