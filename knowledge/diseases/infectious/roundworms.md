# Roundworms (Ascaridia)

## Overview

Roundworm infection in parrots is caused primarily by *Ascaridia* species, large nematode parasites that inhabit the small intestine. *Ascaridia hermaphrodita* and *Ascaridia platyceri* are the species most commonly found in psittacine birds. These are among the largest intestinal parasites found in pet parrots, with adult worms measuring several centimeters in length. Roundworms have a direct life cycle, meaning no intermediate host is required. Eggs are shed in the droppings, become infective in the environment after a period of development, and are ingested by new hosts. Heavy infections can cause significant gastrointestinal disease and even intestinal obstruction.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can be affected, but roundworms are more commonly seen in birds with access to outdoor aviaries or ground-level housing where they can ingest infective eggs from contaminated soil or surfaces. Australian parakeets, cockatiels, budgerigars, macaws, and Amazon parrots have all been reported with *Ascaridia* infections. Wild-caught birds and aviary-housed birds have higher prevalence than indoor-only companion birds.

## Causes

Infection occurs through ingestion of embryonated (infective) eggs from the environment. After being shed in feces, eggs require approximately two to four weeks of development at appropriate temperature and humidity to become infective. Infective eggs can persist in the environment for months to years under favorable conditions. Overcrowding, floor-level housing, poor sanitation, and exposure to contaminated soil are primary risk factors. Earthworms may serve as transport hosts, carrying infective eggs on their surfaces or within their bodies.

## Symptoms

- Weight loss despite adequate food intake
- Diarrhea or loose droppings
- Decreased appetite
- Lethargy and depression
- Visible worms passed in droppings (adult worms are large enough to be seen)
- Abdominal distension
- Intestinal obstruction in heavy infections (emergency)
- Poor feather condition
- Stunted growth in young birds

## Diagnosis

Fecal flotation examination is the standard diagnostic method, revealing characteristic large, oval, thick-shelled eggs. Direct fecal smear can also detect eggs. Adult worms may occasionally be seen in droppings or regurgitated material. Post-mortem examination in fatal cases reveals adult worms within the intestinal lumen. Egg counts from quantitative fecal techniques help assess the worm burden. Radiography may show soft tissue densities or intestinal obstruction in severe cases.

## Treatment

Fenbendazole is the anthelmintic of choice for roundworm infections in parrots, typically administered orally for 3 to 5 days. Pyrantel pamoate is an alternative that can be given as a single dose. Ivermectin administered orally or by injection is also effective. Levamisole has been used but has a narrower safety margin in birds. Treatment should be repeated in two to three weeks to eliminate larvae that were not susceptible to the initial treatment. In cases of intestinal obstruction, emergency surgical intervention may be required. Supportive care including fluid therapy and nutritional support should be provided for debilitated birds.

## Prevention

- Maintain clean cage and aviary environments with regular removal of droppings
- Avoid ground-level housing where fecal contamination of soil occurs
- Use wire-bottom cages or elevated food and water stations in aviaries
- Regular fecal parasite screening, especially for aviary birds
- Quarantine and deworm new birds before introduction to established flocks
- Prevent access to earthworms and potentially contaminated soil
- Routine prophylactic deworming protocols for aviary collections

## Prognosis

The prognosis for roundworm infection is good with appropriate anthelmintic treatment. Most birds respond well to fenbendazole or other dewormers, and clinical signs resolve as the worm burden is eliminated. Heavy infections causing intestinal obstruction carry a more serious prognosis and may require surgical intervention. Reinfection is possible if environmental contamination persists, so ongoing prevention measures are essential.
