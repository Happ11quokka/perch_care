# Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)

## Overview
Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) is one of the most significant and devastating viral diseases affecting parrots worldwide. It is caused by Beak and Feather Disease Virus (BFDV), a member of the family Circoviridae. The disease is characterized by progressive feather dystrophy, beak deformities, and severe immunosuppression. There is no cure for PBFD, and infected birds typically succumb to secondary infections due to their compromised immune systems. BFDV is highly contagious and environmentally persistent, making it a major concern in aviculture.

## Affected Species
All psittacine species are susceptible, but Old World species appear to be most severely affected. Cockatoos (particularly sulphur-crested and umbrella cockatoos), African grey parrots, Eclectus parrots, lovebirds, and budgerigars are among the most commonly affected. In cockatoos, the disease often follows a chronic course with progressive feather loss. In budgerigars, a condition known as "French moult" is now known to be caused by BFDV. Lovebirds and lorikeets can develop peracute forms with rapid death. Some New World species may carry the virus with less severe clinical presentation.

## Causes
BFDV is a small, non-enveloped, circular single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the genus Circovirus. Its small size and lack of a lipid envelope make it extremely resistant to environmental degradation and many common disinfectants. The virus can persist in the environment for months to years. Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected birds, inhalation of contaminated feather dust and dander, ingestion of contaminated fecal material, and contact with contaminated surfaces. Vertical transmission from infected hens to eggs also occurs. The virus targets rapidly dividing cells, particularly in feather follicles, beak, and the immune system (bursa of Fabricius and thymus).

## Symptoms
Clinical presentation varies with the age of the bird and species affected. The peracute form is seen in neonates and young birds, presenting with septicemia, pneumonia, enteritis, rapid weight loss, and death, often before feather abnormalities develop. The acute form in young birds causes symmetric feather loss, necrosis of developing feathers, and feather dystrophy (pinched, clubbed, or blood-filled feather shafts). The chronic form, most classic in cockatoos, shows progressive feather loss over successive molts, with replacement feathers becoming increasingly abnormal until the bird is completely bald. Beak abnormalities include elongation, fracturing, and palatine necrosis. Severe immunosuppression leads to recurrent secondary bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.

## Diagnosis
PCR testing of blood (whole blood or buffy coat) and feather samples is the gold standard for diagnosis. A positive PCR from blood indicates viremia, while positive feather PCR alone may indicate environmental contamination or feather follicle infection. Two PCR tests performed 90 days apart are recommended to differentiate transient from persistent infection. Hemagglutination assays and hemagglutination inhibition tests can detect virus and antibodies respectively. Feather biopsy with histopathology shows characteristic basophilic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in feather follicle epithelium. Hematology may reveal lymphopenia and anemia reflecting immunosuppression.

## Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment or cure for PBFD. Management is supportive and aimed at maintaining quality of life and managing secondary infections. Supportive care includes optimal nutrition, stress reduction, warmth, and prompt treatment of secondary bacterial and fungal infections with appropriate antimicrobials. Some birds, particularly adults with strong immune systems, may seroconvert and clear the virus spontaneously, though this is unpredictable. Experimental treatments including interferon and immunostimulants have been attempted with variable results. Birds that develop the chronic progressive form ultimately succumb to secondary infections or organ failure.

## Prevention
Testing all new birds with PCR before introducing them to existing flocks is the single most important preventive measure. Quarantine new arrivals for a minimum of 30-45 days with testing at the beginning and end of the quarantine period. Maintain strict biosecurity in breeding facilities. BFDV is resistant to many disinfectants; effective agents include 10% bleach, glutaraldehyde, and oxidizing agents. Remove and replace all organic material before disinfection, as organic matter inactivates many disinfectants. A commercial vaccine has been developed and is used in some regions, primarily in Australia, though availability varies.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for PBFD is generally poor to grave for birds that develop persistent infection with clinical signs. Young birds infected before their immune system matures almost invariably develop progressive disease and die. Adult birds with strong immune responses may occasionally clear the virus, especially if they are exposed without developing clinical signs. Birds with the chronic progressive form will continue to deteriorate over months to years. The immunosuppression is ultimately the most life-threatening aspect, as it renders birds unable to fight secondary infections.
