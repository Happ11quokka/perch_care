# Megabacteriosis (Avian Gastric Yeast)

## Overview

Megabacteriosis is a chronic gastrointestinal disease caused by *Macrorhabdus ornithogaster*, formerly known as "megabacteria." Despite the name, *Macrorhabdus ornithogaster* is actually a large, rod-shaped anamorphic yeast organism, not a bacterium. It colonizes the junction between the proventriculus (glandular stomach) and ventriculus (muscular stomach/gizzard) of affected birds. The organism was historically classified as a large bacterium due to its unusual morphology, but molecular analysis confirmed its fungal nature. Megabacteriosis causes chronic wasting, regurgitation, and progressive debilitation, and can be fatal if untreated.

## Affected Species

Budgerigars (parakeets) are the most commonly and severely affected species. The disease also occurs in cockatiels, lovebirds, parrotlets, canaries, finches, and other small psittacines and passerines. Larger parrots can be affected but the disease is less commonly reported in macaws, cockatoos, and African Grey Parrots. Some birds may carry the organism without showing clinical signs, serving as asymptomatic carriers that can transmit infection to others.

## Causes

The organism *Macrorhabdus ornithogaster* is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, ingestion of contaminated food or water, and direct contact with infected birds. Parent birds can transmit the yeast to chicks during feeding. Predisposing factors include stress, concurrent illness, immunosuppression, poor nutrition, overcrowding, and disruption of normal gastrointestinal flora. The organism damages the proventricular lining, interfering with normal gastric acid production and digestion.

## Symptoms

- Progressive weight loss despite a good appetite
- Regurgitation or vomiting
- Passage of undigested food in droppings
- Fluffed feathers and lethargy
- Diarrhea or abnormal droppings
- Grinding of the beak (a sign of nausea or pain)
- Chronic wasting and emaciation
- Sudden death can occur in acute cases

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is typically made by microscopic examination of fresh fecal samples or crop swabs, where the large, rod-shaped organisms (approximately 20-90 micrometers long) are visible under light microscopy with Gram stain, appearing as large Gram-positive rods. The organisms can also be identified in proventricular wash samples. Histopathology of proventricular biopsies shows organisms colonizing the mucosal surface. PCR testing can confirm the diagnosis. Radiography may reveal proventricular dilation in chronic cases.

## Treatment

Amphotericin B administered orally is the primary treatment for megabacteriosis. It is given directly into the crop, as systemic absorption is minimal. Treatment courses typically last 10 to 30 days and may need to be repeated. Sodium benzoate added to drinking water has been used as an adjunctive therapy to acidify the gastrointestinal environment. Supportive care including fluid therapy, nutritional support, and treatment of secondary bacterial infections is important. Some practitioners use fluconazole or nystatin, though their efficacy against *Macrorhabdus* is debated.

## Prevention

- Quarantine and test new birds before introducing them to a flock
- Maintain strict hygiene in aviaries and breeding facilities
- Clean food and water dishes daily
- Avoid overcrowding and minimize stress
- Provide a balanced, nutritious diet to support immune function
- Separate birds showing signs of illness promptly
- Screen breeding birds for asymptomatic carriage

## Prognosis

The prognosis varies depending on the severity and duration of infection. Birds diagnosed early and treated promptly have a fair prognosis. Chronic cases with significant weight loss and proventricular damage carry a guarded prognosis. Relapse is common, and some birds may require repeated treatment courses. Asymptomatic carriers may never develop clinical disease but can serve as a source of infection for susceptible flock mates.
