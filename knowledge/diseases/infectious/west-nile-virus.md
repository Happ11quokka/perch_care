# West Nile Virus

## Overview
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus belonging to the family Flaviviridae that can infect a wide range of bird species and mammals, including humans. The virus is maintained in nature through a bird-mosquito-bird transmission cycle, with wild birds serving as the primary amplifying hosts. While WNV has been documented to cause severe and often fatal disease in many wild bird species (particularly corvids), clinical disease in pet parrots is relatively rare. However, pet parrots are susceptible to infection, and the disease can cause significant neurological disease when it occurs.

## Affected Species
Among wild birds, corvids (crows, jays, ravens) are the most susceptible and serve as sentinel species for monitoring WNV activity. In the psittacine family, documented cases have been reported in various species, though clinical disease is uncommon compared to wild birds. Species reported with clinical WNV infection include budgerigars, cockatiels, and various larger parrots. Raptors (hawks, owls, eagles) are also highly susceptible. The relatively low incidence in pet parrots is likely related to their predominantly indoor housing, which limits mosquito exposure. Birds housed in outdoor aviaries in endemic regions face the greatest risk, particularly during peak mosquito season.

## Causes
West Nile Virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus classified in the genus Flavivirus. It is closely related to other flaviviruses such as St. Louis encephalitis virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. The primary transmission cycle involves mosquitoes (primarily *Culex* species) that acquire the virus by feeding on viremic birds and transmit it to other birds during subsequent blood meals. Infected birds develop viremia that lasts several days, during which they serve as amplifying hosts. Transmission to parrots occurs through bites of infected mosquitoes. Other potential transmission routes include direct contact with infected bird secretions, oral ingestion of infected prey or carcasses, and vertical transmission, though mosquito-borne transmission is by far the most significant.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs in parrots, when they occur, are predominantly neurological. Birds may develop depression, lethargy, anorexia, and weakness as initial signs. Neurological manifestations include ataxia, head tilt, circling, tremors, seizures, blindness, abnormal head positions, and paralysis of one or both legs or wings. Some birds develop a characteristic posture with the head held down or to one side. Ocular signs including uveitis and chorioretinitis have been reported. Weight loss, ruffled feathers, and decreased vocalization may be noted. In some cases, sudden death occurs without prior clinical signs. Mild or subclinical infections likely occur more frequently than clinical disease, with birds seroconverting without showing obvious signs of illness.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical signs, geographic location during mosquito season, and laboratory confirmation. PCR testing of blood, oral, or cloacal swabs can detect viral RNA during the acute viremic phase. Serology using IgM-capture ELISA or plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) can detect antibodies, with IgM indicating recent infection. Paired serology showing seroconversion or a fourfold rise in antibody titers is confirmatory. In deceased birds, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of brain and other tissues can identify viral antigen. Histopathology of the brain reveals encephalitis with lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing and neuronal necrosis. Virus isolation from tissue samples can provide definitive diagnosis.

## Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment for WNV in birds. Treatment is entirely supportive and symptomatic. Birds with neurological signs require intensive care including assisted feeding (tube feeding or hand feeding), fluid therapy, anti-inflammatory medications (such as meloxicam), and seizure control if needed. Maintain birds in a warm, quiet, padded environment to prevent injury from ataxia or seizures. Physical therapy may be beneficial for birds with limb weakness or paralysis. Treatment of secondary infections is important, as immunocompromise may predispose to opportunistic pathogens. Recovery may take weeks to months, and some neurological deficits may be permanent.

## Prevention
Mosquito control and prevention of mosquito bites are the most important protective measures. House birds indoors, particularly during dusk and dawn when *Culex* mosquitoes are most active. Use fine mesh screening on windows and outdoor enclosures to prevent mosquito entry. Eliminate standing water near bird housing areas to reduce mosquito breeding habitat. Use bird-safe mosquito control measures in the environment. An equine WNV vaccine has been used off-label in some valuable psittacine birds, though its efficacy in parrots has not been formally established. Monitor local public health advisories for WNV activity in your region during mosquito season.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for clinical WNV infection in parrots is guarded. Many birds with severe neurological signs do not survive despite supportive care. However, some birds with milder presentations or those receiving prompt, aggressive supportive care can recover. Recovery may be prolonged, taking weeks to months, and residual neurological deficits (such as persistent head tilt or mild ataxia) are possible. Birds that develop antibodies without clinical disease generally fare well. The overall prognosis for pet parrots is better than for highly susceptible wild species like corvids, as psittacines appear to be somewhat less susceptible to fatal disease.
