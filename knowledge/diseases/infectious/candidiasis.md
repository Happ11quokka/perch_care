# Candidiasis (Thrush)

## Overview

Candidiasis, commonly known as thrush, is a fungal infection caused by *Candida albicans*, an opportunistic yeast organism. It primarily affects the upper gastrointestinal tract of parrots, particularly the crop, mouth, and esophagus. *Candida* is a normal commensal organism in small numbers in the avian digestive tract, but overgrowth occurs when the bird's immune system is compromised or the normal bacterial flora is disrupted. Candidiasis is one of the most frequently diagnosed fungal infections in hand-fed chicks and juvenile parrots.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can be affected, but hand-fed neonates and juvenile birds are most susceptible. Macaws, cockatoos, and African Grey Parrots frequently develop candidiasis during hand-rearing. Adult birds on prolonged antibiotic therapy or with underlying illness are also at risk.

## Causes

Candidiasis results from overgrowth of *Candida albicans* yeast. Predisposing factors include prolonged antibiotic use (which disrupts normal gut flora), immunosuppression, poor hygiene during hand-feeding, contaminated feeding equipment, vitamin A deficiency, stress, and malnutrition. Feeding formula at incorrect temperatures or consistency can damage the crop lining and promote yeast colonization. Poor crop motility (crop stasis) in chicks creates a favorable environment for yeast proliferation.

## Symptoms

- White, raised plaques or patches in the mouth, tongue, and crop
- Thickened crop lining (palpable through the skin)
- Regurgitation or vomiting
- Slow crop emptying (crop stasis)
- Decreased appetite or refusal to feed
- Weight loss
- Mucoid or foul-smelling droppings
- Lethargy and fluffed feathers

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is typically straightforward. Gram stain or cytology of crop swabs reveals characteristic budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae. Crop wash samples examined microscopically confirm the diagnosis. Culture on Sabouraud dextrose agar can be performed for definitive identification but is rarely necessary. The presence of hyphae or pseudohyphae indicates active tissue invasion rather than simple colonization.

## Treatment

Nystatin is the first-line treatment for localized crop and oral candidiasis, as it is not absorbed systemically and acts directly on the yeast in the gastrointestinal tract. For systemic or refractory infections, fluconazole or itraconazole may be prescribed. Treatment typically lasts 7 to 14 days. Underlying causes must be addressed, including discontinuing unnecessary antibiotics, correcting hand-feeding technique, and improving nutrition. Probiotic supplementation may help restore normal gut flora.

## Prevention

- Maintain strict hygiene of all hand-feeding equipment (syringes, spoons, formula containers)
- Prepare fresh formula for each feeding and discard unused portions
- Feed formula at the correct temperature (approximately 105-110 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Avoid unnecessary or prolonged antibiotic use
- Ensure adequate vitamin A in the diet
- Reduce stress and overcrowding

## Prognosis

The prognosis for uncomplicated candidiasis is excellent with appropriate antifungal treatment and correction of predisposing factors. Most birds respond within one to two weeks. However, recurrence is common if underlying causes such as poor diet, unsanitary conditions, or immunosuppression are not addressed. Systemic candidiasis in severely debilitated birds carries a more guarded prognosis.
