# Feather Mites

## Overview

Feather mites encompass a variety of ectoparasitic mite species that inhabit the feathers, skin surface, and feather follicles of parrots and other birds. Common genera include *Syringophilus* (quill mites), *Dermoglyphus* (feather mites), *Proctophyllodes*, and *Pterolichus*. Unlike burrowing mites such as *Knemidocoptes*, feather mites live on the surface of the feathers or within the feather shaft, feeding on feather debris, skin oils, or feather keratin. While many feather mite species are considered commensal and cause minimal harm, heavy infestations can lead to significant feather damage, irritation, and stress in pet parrots.

## Affected Species

All parrot species can be affected by feather mites, though infestations are more commonly reported in budgerigars, cockatiels, and other small psittacines. Wild-caught or outdoor-housed birds have higher exposure risk. Larger parrots such as macaws, cockatoos, and African Grey Parrots may also be infested, particularly if housed in outdoor aviaries or exposed to wild birds.

## Causes

Feather mites are transmitted through direct bird-to-bird contact, shared perches, nesting material, and contact with wild birds. The mites complete their life cycle on the host bird. Poor environmental hygiene, overcrowding, stress, and immunosuppression can worsen the severity of infestations. The mites feed on feather structures, skin debris, and oils, causing mechanical damage to feathers and irritation to the skin.

## Symptoms

- Excessive preening and scratching
- Feather damage including frayed, broken, or chewed feathers
- Feather loss or patchy areas
- Restlessness, especially at night (mites are often more active in darkness)
- Visible tiny mites moving on feathers (may require magnification)
- Irritated or reddened skin
- Decreased feather quality and dull plumage
- Stress-related behavioral changes

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis involves direct visualization of mites on feathers using a magnifying glass or microscope. Feathers can be examined under low-power microscopy to identify mites and their eggs along the feather barbs or within the feather shaft. Quill mites can be identified by cutting open affected feather quills and examining contents microscopically. Skin scrapings may be performed to rule out other ectoparasites. It is important to differentiate feather mite damage from feather destructive behavior (feather plucking), which has different underlying causes.

## Treatment

Ivermectin is the most commonly used treatment, administered topically or by injection, repeated at 10 to 14 day intervals for two to three treatments. Pyrethrin-based sprays approved for use in birds can be applied directly to the feathers. Moxidectin spot-on treatments are also effective. Environmental treatment is essential: cages, perches, and nesting material should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Fipronil spray has been used in some cases under veterinary supervision, though it must be used cautiously in birds. All birds in contact should be treated simultaneously to prevent reinfestation.

## Prevention

- Quarantine new birds for a minimum of 30 days before introduction
- Regular physical examination of feathers for signs of mite activity
- Keep cages and perches clean and disinfected
- Limit exposure to wild birds
- Maintain proper nutrition to support feather health and immune function
- Provide regular bathing or misting opportunities to maintain feather condition

## Prognosis

The prognosis for feather mite infestation is good with appropriate treatment. Most birds recover fully, and feather quality improves after the next molt cycle. Chronic or untreated infestations can lead to significant feather damage and secondary skin infections but are rarely life-threatening. Reinfestation is possible if the source of exposure is not eliminated.
