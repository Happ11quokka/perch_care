# Papillomavirus

## Overview
Papillomavirus infections in parrots are caused by avian papillomaviruses, small non-enveloped DNA viruses belonging to the family Papillomaviridae. In psittacine birds, papillomatosis most commonly presents as wart-like growths (papillomas) on the skin, cloaca, and oral cavity. The condition has been closely associated with Psittacid Herpesvirus (PsHV-1), as many birds with papillomas are also positive for herpesvirus, suggesting a possible co-factor relationship. While papillomas are generally benign, they can cause significant morbidity depending on their location and may rarely undergo malignant transformation.

## Affected Species
Amazon parrots are the most commonly affected species, with green-cheeked Amazons, blue-fronted Amazons, and yellow-naped Amazons being particularly prone to cloacal papillomas. Macaws, particularly green-winged and blue-and-gold macaws, also develop papillomatous lesions. Conures, including nanday and Patagonian conures, frequently develop papillomas, and there is a notable overlap with species known to carry PsHV-1. Cockatoos, African grey parrots, and hawk-headed parrots have also been reported with papillomatous lesions. The condition is most commonly recognized in adult birds.

## Causes
The precise etiology of psittacine papillomatosis is still debated. While avian papillomaviruses (specifically Psittacus erithacus papillomavirus, PePV) have been identified in some lesions, many cases appear to be associated with Psittacid Herpesvirus 1 (PsHV-1), the same virus that causes Pacheco's disease. Some researchers believe PsHV-1 may be the primary cause of internal papillomas (cloacal, oral), while true papillomaviruses cause cutaneous warts. Transmission is thought to occur through direct contact with infected birds or contaminated secretions. The role of latent herpesvirus infection and stress-induced reactivation in the development of papillomas is an area of ongoing research.

## Symptoms
Cloacal papillomas are the most common presentation, appearing as pink, red, or pale pedunculated or sessile masses protruding from the cloaca or visible on cloacal examination. These can cause straining during defecation, bloody droppings, foul-smelling discharge, and prolapse of the cloacal tissue. Oral papillomas present as wart-like growths on the tongue, palate, choana, or oropharyngeal mucosa and may cause difficulty eating or voice changes. Cutaneous papillomas appear as raised, rough-surfaced growths on the skin, particularly on the feet, legs, or around the eyes. Papillomas involving the bile duct or pancreatic duct have been reported and can cause jaundice, pancreatitis, and significant morbidity.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is typically based on visual inspection of characteristic papillomatous lesions, confirmed by histopathological examination of biopsy specimens. Histopathology reveals epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis with characteristic koilocytic changes. Cloacal examination under anesthesia may be necessary to fully evaluate the extent of cloacal papillomatosis. PCR testing can detect papillomavirus or herpesvirus DNA in lesion tissue. Testing for PsHV-1 (via PCR of blood or cloacal swabs) is recommended given the association between herpesvirus and papillomatosis. Biopsy is important to differentiate papillomas from squamous cell carcinoma or other neoplasia, especially in cases where malignant transformation is suspected.

## Treatment
Surgical removal is the primary treatment for papillomas causing clinical problems. Methods include surgical excision, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and chemical cauterization with silver nitrate. Laser surgery (CO2 laser) provides precise removal with minimal bleeding and tissue damage. Recurrence after surgical removal is common, and multiple procedures may be necessary. Autogenous vaccines (prepared from the bird's own papilloma tissue) have been used with variable success in reducing recurrence rates. If PsHV-1 is confirmed, management of the underlying herpesvirus infection may be considered, though the role of antiviral therapy in papillomatosis is not well established. Anti-inflammatory medications and topical treatments may help manage discomfort.

## Prevention
Since the exact transmission dynamics are not fully understood, prevention centers on general biosecurity measures. Quarantine new birds and test for PsHV-1 before introducing them to existing collections. Minimize stress in known carrier birds to reduce herpesvirus reactivation. Maintain good hygiene and avoid sharing food dishes or perches between known infected and uninfected birds. Regular veterinary examinations including cloacal inspection can detect papillomas early. Species known to carry PsHV-1 (particularly certain conure species) should be housed separately from susceptible species when possible.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for superficial papillomas is generally fair to good, as the lesions are benign and can often be managed with surgical removal. However, recurrence rates are high, and some birds require ongoing management with periodic procedures. The prognosis becomes more guarded with internal papillomas affecting the bile duct or pancreatic duct, which can cause serious complications. Rare malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma has been reported, warranting monitoring of chronic or recurrent lesions. Overall quality of life can be maintained in most cases with appropriate veterinary management.
