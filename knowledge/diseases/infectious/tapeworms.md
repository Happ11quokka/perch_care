# Tapeworms (Cestodes)

## Overview

Tapeworm infections in parrots are caused by cestode parasites, segmented flatworms that inhabit the intestinal tract. Unlike roundworms, tapeworms have an indirect life cycle, requiring an intermediate host (typically an invertebrate such as a beetle, fly, ant, or other arthropod) to complete their development. The most commonly reported cestode genera in psittacine birds include *Raillietina* and *Choanotaenia*. Tapeworm infections are considered rare in indoor-housed pet parrots because of the need for an intermediate host, but they can occur in aviary birds or those with access to outdoor environments where they may ingest infected insects.

## Affected Species

Any parrot species can potentially be affected, though tapeworm infections are uncommon in companion birds kept exclusively indoors. Aviary-housed birds, birds with access to outdoor flights, and those in environments where insects are present are at greater risk. Australian parakeets, cockatiels, and budgerigars housed in outdoor aviaries have been reported with cestode infections. Wild-caught parrots may also harbor tapeworms acquired before capture.

## Causes

Tapeworm infection requires ingestion of an infected intermediate host, typically an arthropod invertebrate (beetles, ants, flies, or other insects) that has consumed tapeworm eggs from the environment. The larval stage (cysticercoid) develops within the intermediate host. When a parrot eats the infected insect, the larval tapeworm is released in the bird's intestinal tract and develops into an adult tapeworm, which attaches to the intestinal wall via its scolex (head) and grows by producing segments (proglottids). Mature proglottids containing eggs detach and are passed in the feces, restarting the cycle.

## Symptoms

- Often asymptomatic in light infections
- Weight loss despite normal appetite
- Diarrhea or loose droppings
- Visible proglottids (small, rice-grain-like segments) in droppings or around the vent
- Decreased activity and lethargy
- Poor feather condition
- Irritation around the cloaca
- In heavy infections, intestinal obstruction or malabsorption

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is typically made by identifying proglottids (tapeworm segments) in the droppings, which appear as small, white, motile, rice-grain-like structures. Fecal flotation may detect tapeworm egg packets, though eggs are often contained within intact proglottids and may not be released into the fecal sample. Proglottids can be examined microscopically to identify the genus based on morphological characteristics of the eggs and segment structure. Post-mortem examination reveals adult tapeworms attached to the intestinal wall.

## Treatment

Praziquantel is the treatment of choice for cestode infections in birds, administered orally or by injection. A single treatment may be sufficient, but repeat dosing at two to three week intervals is recommended to ensure complete elimination. Praziquantel causes paralysis and disintegration of the tapeworm, and treated birds may pass worm fragments in their droppings after treatment. Environmental control of intermediate hosts (insect control) is essential to prevent reinfection. Insecticides or physical barriers to reduce insect access to aviaries should be implemented alongside treatment.

## Prevention

- Control insects in and around aviaries (use bird-safe insect control methods)
- Use screened enclosures to reduce insect exposure
- Maintain clean aviary environments to discourage insect breeding
- Regular fecal examinations for aviary-housed birds
- Quarantine and screen new birds
- Indoor-only housing effectively prevents tapeworm acquisition
- Remove potential insect-attracting materials (decaying food, standing water)

## Prognosis

The prognosis for tapeworm infection is excellent with appropriate treatment. Praziquantel is highly effective, and most birds clear the infection after one or two treatments. Clinical signs resolve rapidly following deworming. The key to long-term success is preventing reinfection by controlling intermediate host populations in the bird's environment. Indoor-housed birds that do not have access to insects are at negligible risk of reinfection.
