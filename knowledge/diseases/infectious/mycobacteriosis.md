# Mycobacteriosis (Avian Tuberculosis)

## Overview
Mycobacteriosis, commonly referred to as avian tuberculosis, is a chronic bacterial infection caused primarily by *Mycobacterium avium* complex (MAC). The disease is characterized by progressive wasting, granuloma formation in multiple organs, and a typically poor prognosis. It carries zoonotic potential, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, making it a significant concern in avian medicine.

## Affected Species
All parrot species can be affected, but the disease is more commonly reported in older birds and those with compromised immune systems. Amazon parrots, macaws, and cockatoos appear to be frequently diagnosed. Birds kept in outdoor aviaries or those with exposure to wild birds and contaminated soil are at increased risk. The disease is also well documented in Brotogeris species and various finch species kept in mixed collections.

## Causes
The primary causative agent is *Mycobacterium avium*, an acid-fast bacterium that is highly resistant to environmental degradation. The organism can persist in soil, water, and organic matter for years. Transmission occurs primarily through the fecal-oral route by ingestion of contaminated food, water, or substrate. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms is another potential route. The bacteria are slow-growing, and the incubation period can range from weeks to years before clinical signs become apparent.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs typically develop insidiously over weeks to months. Progressive weight loss despite a maintained or even increased appetite is the most characteristic sign. Birds may develop diarrhea, often with undigested food visible in droppings. Subcutaneous granulomas may present as firm swellings on the body, particularly around the head, limbs, or keel. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may be palpable. Advanced cases show severe muscle wasting over the keel bone, lethargy, and poor feather condition. Some birds develop lameness from granulomas involving bones or joints.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be challenging due to the chronic and insidious nature of the disease. Acid-fast staining of fecal samples may reveal organisms, though sensitivity is variable. PCR testing is more reliable for detecting mycobacterial DNA in feces or tissue samples. Hematology may show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Radiographs can reveal hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and sometimes bony lesions. Definitive diagnosis often requires biopsy with histopathology showing characteristic granulomatous inflammation with acid-fast organisms. Culture is possible but extremely slow, taking 6-8 weeks or longer.

## Treatment
Treatment of avian mycobacteriosis is controversial and generally considered unrewarding. Multi-drug antibiotic protocols using combinations such as ethambutol, rifampin, and azithromycin or clarithromycin have been attempted, with treatment courses lasting 12-18 months or longer. Response to therapy is inconsistent, and relapses are common. The zoonotic risk must be carefully discussed with owners, particularly those who are immunocompromised. Many avian veterinarians recommend euthanasia due to the poor prognosis and public health concerns.

## Prevention
Quarantine all new birds and screen for mycobacteriosis before introducing them into an existing collection. Maintain strict hygiene with regular cleaning and disinfection of enclosures. Avoid contact with wild birds and contaminated soil. Feed clean, uncontaminated food and water. Minimize stress and maintain optimal nutrition to support immune function. Routine health examinations including fecal acid-fast staining can help detect infections early.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for avian mycobacteriosis is generally poor to grave. The chronic, progressive nature of the disease combined with the difficulty of achieving complete bacterial elimination makes long-term survival unlikely. Even with aggressive treatment, many birds eventually succumb to the disease. The zoonotic potential adds another layer of concern, and euthanasia should be discussed as a responsible option, especially in households with immunocompromised individuals.
