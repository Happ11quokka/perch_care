# Avian Paramyxovirus

## Overview
Avian Paramyxoviruses (APMVs) are a group of related viruses belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae that can cause a range of diseases in birds. While APMV-1 (Newcastle disease virus) is the most well-known and clinically significant serotype, multiple additional serotypes (APMV-2 through APMV-12 and beyond) have been identified, several of which can cause disease in psittacine birds. These viruses primarily cause neurological and respiratory signs, with severity varying by serotype, host species, and immune status. APMV-3, in particular, has been associated with clinical disease outbreaks in psittacine collections.

## Affected Species
All bird species are considered susceptible to various APMV serotypes, though clinical significance varies. Among psittacines, APMV-3 (originally called Neurovelogenic Newcastle Disease virus of psittacines) is particularly notable and has been isolated from Neophema species, budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, and various other small psittacines. APMV-5 has been associated with disease in budgerigars. Larger psittacines including Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and macaws can also be affected. Finches and other passerines are susceptible to certain serotypes. The diversity of APMV serotypes means that different species may have varying susceptibility to different serotypes.

## Causes
Avian Paramyxoviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses. Multiple serotypes are recognized based on hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition assays. The most relevant serotypes for psittacine medicine include APMV-1 (Newcastle disease virus, covered separately), APMV-2 (associated with mild respiratory disease), APMV-3 (significant in psittacines, causing neurological disease), and APMV-5 (causing acute disease in budgerigars). Transmission occurs through direct contact with infected birds, inhalation of aerosolized respiratory secretions, and ingestion of contaminated fecal material. Environmental contamination via contaminated water, food, and fomites also plays a role. The viruses can survive in the environment for variable periods depending on conditions.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs vary with the serotype and host species. Neurological signs are the most characteristic and include torticollis (head twisting), opisthotonos, circling, tremors, ataxia, paralysis of one or more limbs, and seizures. Respiratory signs include sneezing, nasal discharge, dyspnea, open-mouth breathing, and abnormal respiratory sounds. Gastrointestinal signs may include diarrhea (which can be green or watery), regurgitation, and decreased appetite. General signs include depression, lethargy, fluffed feathers, and weight loss. APMV-3 infections in Neophema and budgerigars often present with acute neurological signs and can cause significant mortality. APMV-5 in budgerigars causes acute depression and death with minimal premonitory signs. Some infections may be subclinical, with birds developing antibodies without showing clinical signs.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation. Virus isolation from oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs is considered the gold standard. PCR testing can detect viral RNA and differentiate between serotypes. Serology using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) testing with type-specific antigens can identify the serotype involved and determine antibody levels. Paired serology demonstrating seroconversion or a fourfold rise in titer is diagnostically significant. Post-mortem examination may reveal encephalitis, airsacculitis, and congestion of internal organs. Histopathology of the brain may show lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis. Distinguishing between APMV serotypes is important for epidemiological purposes and may influence reportability, as APMV-1 is reportable while other serotypes generally are not.

## Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment for APMV infections. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Birds with neurological signs require careful management including assisted feeding, fluid therapy, and a padded, warm environment to prevent injury. Anti-inflammatory medications (such as meloxicam) may help reduce CNS inflammation. Seizure control with appropriate anticonvulsant medications may be necessary. Treatment of secondary bacterial or fungal infections is important, as viral infection can compromise immune function. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may aid recovery in birds with persistent neurological deficits. Nutritional support with easily digestible foods and vitamin supplementation supports immune function.

## Prevention
Quarantine all new birds for a minimum of 30-45 days with appropriate monitoring before introduction to existing collections. PCR testing and serology of new arrivals can help identify infected or carrier birds. Maintain strict biosecurity with separate equipment for different groups of birds. Prevent contact with wild birds, which can serve as reservoirs for various APMV serotypes. Vaccines are available for APMV-1 (Newcastle disease) and are commonly used in poultry; their use in pet parrots is less standardized. For other APMV serotypes, no commercial vaccines are widely available for psittacines. Good hygiene, proper ventilation, and stress reduction are general preventive measures.

## Prognosis
The prognosis varies depending on the serotype involved, the severity of clinical signs, and the species affected. Birds with mild respiratory signs from less pathogenic serotypes generally have a good prognosis with supportive care. Severe neurological disease carries a more guarded prognosis, with some birds developing permanent neurological deficits or succumbing despite treatment. APMV-3 infections in small psittacines can have significant mortality rates in outbreaks. APMV-5 in budgerigars is associated with high mortality. Birds that recover may develop protective immunity against the specific serotype but remain susceptible to other serotypes.
