# Avian Poxvirus

## Overview
Avian pox is a viral disease caused by viruses of the genus Avipoxvirus within the family Poxviridae. The disease manifests in two primary forms: the dry (cutaneous) form, characterized by nodular skin lesions, and the wet (diphtheritic) form, characterized by proliferative lesions on the mucous membranes of the mouth, throat, and upper respiratory tract. Avian pox is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes and other biting insects, making it seasonal in temperate climates. While the disease can affect pet parrots, it is more commonly seen in outdoor-housed birds or those in regions with high mosquito activity.

## Affected Species
All psittacine species are susceptible to avian poxvirus infection. Amazon parrots, particularly blue-fronted Amazons, appear to be commonly affected among pet parrots. Budgerigars, lovebirds, and macaws are also reported with clinical disease. The disease is frequently seen in wild bird populations and can be transmitted to pet birds housed outdoors. Canaries and other passerine species are also commonly affected by their species-specific poxviruses. Species-specific poxviruses exist, though some cross-species transmission can occur.

## Causes
Avipoxviruses are large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that are relatively resistant in the environment. The primary mode of transmission is through mosquito bites, though other biting insects (mites, flies) can also serve as vectors. Direct transmission through contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces (fomites) is also possible. The virus can enter through skin abrasions, wounds, or mucous membranes. Aerosol transmission may occur in the diphtheritic form. The virus can survive in dried scabs and environmental contamination for months to years. Seasonal outbreaks coincide with periods of high mosquito activity in temperate regions, while in tropical regions, transmission may occur year-round.

## Symptoms
The dry (cutaneous) form presents with raised, wart-like nodules on unfeathered skin areas, particularly around the eyes, cere, beak commissures, feet, and legs. These lesions progress from small papules to larger proliferative masses that may become crusted and darkened. Lesions around the eyes can cause swelling that impairs vision. The wet (diphtheritic) form involves yellow-white, cheese-like plaques on the mucous membranes of the mouth, tongue, larynx, and trachea. These lesions can cause dyspnea, dysphagia, and significant morbidity. In severe cases, airway obstruction from diphtheritic lesions can be fatal. A septicemic form has been described with high mortality, though this is less common. Secondary bacterial or fungal infections of pox lesions are common complications.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often based on characteristic clinical appearance of the lesions. Histopathology of biopsy specimens is confirmatory, revealing epithelial hyperplasia with characteristic eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Bollinger bodies). Electron microscopy can visualize the typical brick-shaped poxvirus particles. PCR testing is available for specific viral identification and genotyping. Virus isolation from lesion material can be performed using embryonated eggs or cell culture. Differential diagnoses include papillomavirus (wart-like lesions), trichomoniasis (oral plaques), candidiasis, vitamin A deficiency (oral plaques), and neoplasia.

## Treatment
There is no specific antiviral treatment for avian pox. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic. Dry pox lesions are managed conservatively, as they typically regress spontaneously over 2-4 weeks once the bird mounts an immune response. Lesions can be gently cleaned with dilute antiseptic solutions to prevent secondary infection. Topical antibiotics may be applied to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections. Diphtheritic lesions may need careful removal to prevent airway obstruction, followed by topical treatment. Systemic antibiotics are indicated when secondary bacterial infections are present. Nutritional support including vitamin A supplementation supports immune function and mucous membrane healing. Severely affected birds may require assisted feeding and fluid therapy.

## Prevention
Mosquito control is the most important preventive measure. House birds indoors or use fine mesh screening on outdoor aviaries to prevent mosquito access. Remove standing water that serves as mosquito breeding habitat near bird enclosures. Use bird-safe mosquito repellent strategies in the environment. Quarantine new birds and isolate any birds showing suspicious lesions. Vaccines are available for some avian pox strains and are commonly used in poultry. Vaccination of pet parrots may be considered in endemic areas or during outbreaks, though species-specific vaccines may not be available for all psittacines. Practice good hygiene and wound care to prevent virus entry through skin breaks.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for the dry (cutaneous) form is generally good, with most immunocompetent birds recovering within 2-4 weeks as lesions regress spontaneously. Scarring may occur at lesion sites, particularly around the eyes and cere. The diphtheritic (wet) form carries a more guarded prognosis due to the risk of airway obstruction, difficulty eating, and secondary infections. Severe cases with extensive diphtheritic involvement or secondary septicemia can be fatal. Recovered birds develop immunity to the infecting strain, though cross-protection between different avipoxvirus strains may be limited.
