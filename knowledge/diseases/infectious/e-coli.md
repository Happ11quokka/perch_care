# E. coli Infections

## Overview
Escherichia coli (*E. coli*) infections are among the most common bacterial diseases encountered in pet parrots. While *E. coli* is considered part of the normal gastrointestinal flora in mammals, it is generally regarded as an abnormal finding in the avian gastrointestinal tract, particularly in psittacine birds. Infections range from mild gastrointestinal disturbances to severe septicemia and death, and are frequently secondary to other underlying conditions that compromise the bird's immune system.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible to *E. coli* infections. Neonates and hand-fed chicks are particularly vulnerable due to their immature immune systems. Budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds, and Amazon parrots are commonly affected in clinical practice. Birds undergoing stress from transportation, environmental changes, or concurrent illness are at heightened risk for developing clinical disease from *E. coli* overgrowth.

## Causes
*E. coli* is a gram-negative bacterium commonly found in the environment, particularly in fecal-contaminated water, soil, and food. Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food, water, or surfaces. In parrots, *E. coli* infections are frequently secondary to immunosuppression caused by viral infections (such as PBFD or polyomavirus), malnutrition, stress, or poor hygiene. Contaminated hand-feeding formulas or improperly cleaned feeding equipment are significant sources of infection in neonatal birds.

## Symptoms
Clinical signs vary depending on the severity and location of infection. Gastrointestinal signs include diarrhea (which may be watery or mucoid), vomiting or regurgitation, and decreased appetite. Systemic infections can cause lethargy, fluffed feathers, dehydration, and weight loss. Septicemia may present with acute depression, rapid breathing, and sudden death. Localized infections can affect the respiratory tract (causing sinusitis or pneumonia), reproductive tract (causing egg peritonitis or salpingitis), or joints (causing arthritis). In neonates, crop stasis, yolk sac infections, and omphalitis are common presentations.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on bacterial culture and sensitivity testing from appropriate samples, including cloacal swabs, fecal samples, crop aspirates, or blood cultures in septicemic cases. Gram staining of fresh droppings revealing excessive gram-negative rods is suggestive. Complete blood count often shows heterophilia with toxic changes in white blood cells. Biochemistry panels may reveal elevated white blood cell counts and changes in liver or kidney parameters depending on organ involvement. It is important to identify and address any underlying conditions that predisposed the bird to infection.

## Treatment
Treatment should be guided by culture and sensitivity results, as antibiotic resistance patterns vary widely among *E. coli* strains. Commonly effective antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and third-generation cephalosporins. Supportive care is essential and includes fluid therapy for dehydration, nutritional support, and heat supplementation. Probiotics may help restore normal gastrointestinal flora after antibiotic therapy. Addressing underlying causes such as poor diet, stress, or concurrent infections is crucial for preventing recurrence.

## Prevention
Maintain strict hygiene by cleaning food and water dishes daily and disinfecting enclosures regularly. Use clean, fresh water sources and avoid allowing birds to access stagnant or contaminated water. Practice proper hand-feeding technique with sterile equipment and freshly prepared formula. Quarantine new birds and perform routine health screening. Provide a balanced, species-appropriate diet to support immune function. Minimize environmental stress through appropriate housing, temperature, and social conditions.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for *E. coli* infections depends on the severity of disease and the presence of underlying conditions. Mild gastrointestinal infections typically respond well to appropriate antibiotic therapy and supportive care. Septicemic infections carry a more guarded prognosis, particularly in young or immunocompromised birds. Identifying and correcting predisposing factors is essential for long-term recovery and prevention of recurrence.
