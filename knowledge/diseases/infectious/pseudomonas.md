# Pseudomonas Infections

## Overview
Pseudomonas infections in parrots are caused primarily by *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, a gram-negative, opportunistic bacterium notorious for its intrinsic resistance to many common antibiotics. This organism thrives in moist environments and is a significant cause of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and systemic infections in pet birds. Pseudomonas infections are often associated with environmental contamination, particularly of water sources and humid enclosures, and can be extremely challenging to treat due to the organism's inherent antimicrobial resistance.

## Affected Species
All parrot species are susceptible, but birds that frequently bathe, consume water-heavy diets, or are housed in humid environments may be at increased risk. Lorikeets and lories, whose nectar-based diets encourage bacterial growth in feeding dishes, are commonly affected. Eclectus parrots, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and macaws are also frequently diagnosed. Neonates and immunocompromised birds are particularly vulnerable to severe systemic disease.

## Causes
*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is ubiquitous in the environment, particularly in water, soil, and on moist surfaces. The bacterium produces biofilms that allow it to colonize water bottles, tubing, humidifiers, and poorly cleaned food and water dishes. Transmission occurs through ingestion of contaminated water or food, inhalation of aerosolized organisms, or contact with contaminated surfaces. Factors predisposing to infection include immunosuppression, concurrent illness, prolonged antibiotic use disrupting normal flora, poor hygiene, and excessive environmental humidity. Standing water in bottles or dishes left for extended periods is a common source.

## Symptoms
Gastrointestinal infection presents with diarrhea, regurgitation, weight loss, and decreased appetite. Respiratory involvement causes nasal discharge (which may be greenish), sneezing, dyspnea, and airsacculitis. Sinusitis with swollen infraorbital sinuses is common. Skin infections may manifest as dermatitis or infected feather follicles. Septicemia leads to acute depression, rapid deterioration, and can be fatal. In neonates, crop infections cause delayed crop emptying, sour crop, and regurgitation of foul-smelling crop contents. Chronic infections may cause persistent weight loss and poor feather quality.

## Diagnosis
Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing from appropriate samples (choanal swabs, cloacal swabs, crop aspirates, or respiratory secretions) is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning. Gram staining reveals gram-negative rods, and Pseudomonas colonies often produce a characteristic blue-green pigment (pyocyanin) and grape-like odor on culture plates. Complete blood count typically shows heterophilia and elevated white blood cell counts. Radiographs may reveal airsacculitis, pneumonia, or hepatomegaly in systemic cases. Environmental sampling of water sources and feeding equipment can identify the source of contamination.

## Treatment
Antibiotic selection must be based on culture and sensitivity results due to the organism's extensive intrinsic and acquired resistance patterns. Potentially effective antibiotics include fluoroquinolones (enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin), ceftazidime, and piperacillin. Topical treatments may be appropriate for localized skin or sinus infections. Nebulization with appropriate antibiotics can be beneficial for respiratory infections. Aggressive supportive care including fluid therapy and nutritional support is essential. Identifying and eliminating the environmental source of contamination is critical for successful treatment.

## Prevention
Replace water daily and thoroughly clean and disinfect all water containers and feeding dishes. Avoid water bottles with stagnant water; open dishes that are cleaned daily are preferred. Clean and disinfect humidifiers, misters, and bathing dishes regularly. Maintain dry, well-ventilated enclosures. Practice proper hygiene in hand-feeding operations. Use drinking water treated with appropriate sanitizers where indicated. Regular environmental cultures can help monitor for Pseudomonas contamination in aviculture settings.

## Prognosis
The prognosis for Pseudomonas infections is guarded, primarily due to the organism's inherent antibiotic resistance. Localized infections detected early and treated with sensitivity-guided antibiotics can resolve successfully. Systemic infections and septicemia carry a poor prognosis, particularly in young or immunocompromised birds. Chronic or recurrent infections are common if the environmental source is not identified and eliminated. Successful long-term resolution requires both appropriate antibiotic therapy and thorough environmental decontamination.
