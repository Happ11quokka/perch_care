# Reproductive Prolapse (Oviductal Prolapse)

## Overview

Reproductive prolapse, specifically oviductal prolapse, occurs when the oviduct (the tube through which eggs travel from the ovary to the cloaca) protrudes outward through the vent. This is distinct from cloacal prolapse, as the tissue involved is reproductive rather than cloacal. The prolapsed tissue appears as a pink to red mass protruding from the vent and may contain a visible egg within it. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate veterinary intervention, as the exposed tissue is vulnerable to desiccation, trauma, infection, and necrosis.

## Affected Species

All egg-laying parrot species can experience oviductal prolapse. It is most commonly seen in cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, and cockatoos. Chronic egg layers and birds with a history of egg-binding episodes are at significantly elevated risk.

## Causes

- **Egg binding**: Prolonged straining to pass a retained egg is the most common cause.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Repeated reproductive stress weakens the oviductal muscles and supporting tissues.
- **Calcium deficiency**: Weakens smooth muscle tone and can lead to thin-shelled eggs that are difficult to pass.
- **Obesity**: Increased coelomic fat puts additional pressure on the reproductive tract.
- **Oversized or malformed eggs**: Large or abnormally shaped eggs require excessive straining.
- **Oviductal infection (salpingitis)**: Inflammation weakens the oviductal wall.
- **Hormonal imbalance**: Excessive reproductive hormone stimulation.
- **Malnutrition**: Overall poor body condition reduces tissue strength and integrity.
- **Dystocia**: Difficult egg passage from any cause.

## Symptoms

- Visible tissue mass protruding from the vent, often with a pinkish-red appearance
- An egg may be visible within the prolapsed tissue
- Straining and tenesmus (continued pushing)
- Blood at or around the vent
- Lethargy and depression
- Loss of appetite
- Inability to defecate normally
- Sitting on the cage floor
- Swelling around the vent
- Tissue becoming dark or black if circulation is compromised (necrosis)

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Visual identification of the prolapsed tissue. Differentiating oviductal prolapse from cloacal prolapse is important and can be determined by tissue appearance and location.
- **Radiographs**: To identify a retained egg, assess bone density (calcium status), and evaluate for additional eggs or reproductive abnormalities.
- **Blood work**: Calcium levels, complete blood count, and chemistry panel to assess overall health and infection status.
- **Ultrasound**: To evaluate the reproductive tract and identify retained eggs or masses.

## Treatment

Reproductive prolapse is an emergency requiring immediate care:

- **Keep tissue moist**: Immediately apply sterile saline, water-based lubricant, or a hypertonic sugar solution to reduce swelling and prevent desiccation.
- **Prevent further trauma**: Place the bird in a clean, padded environment. Use an Elizabethan collar if the bird is pecking at the tissue.
- **Veterinary reduction**: The veterinarian will gently clean the tissue, reduce any swelling, and attempt to replace the prolapsed oviduct. If an egg is present, it may need to be removed (ovocentesis or manual extraction) before reduction.
- **Purse-string suture**: A temporary suture around the vent to hold the tissue in place while allowing droppings to pass.
- **Calcium supplementation**: Injectable calcium gluconate to restore calcium levels and improve muscle tone.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam for pain and swelling.
- **Antibiotics**: To prevent or treat secondary infection of the prolapsed tissue.
- **Hormone therapy**: Leuprolide (Lupron) or Deslorelin implant to suppress further ovulation and prevent recurrence.
- **Surgery (salpingohysterectomy)**: In cases of severe or recurrent prolapse, surgical removal of the oviduct may be necessary. If the prolapsed tissue is necrotic, surgical amputation and oviduct removal are required.

## Prevention

- Address chronic egg-laying behavior with environmental modification and hormone therapy.
- Maintain adequate dietary calcium and overall nutrition.
- Keep birds at a healthy weight through proper diet and exercise.
- Provide 10-12 hours of light and 12-14 hours of uninterrupted darkness.
- Remove nesting stimuli from the environment.
- Avoid petting the back, wings, or tail area.
- Seek early veterinary attention for egg-binding episodes.

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on the severity and duration of the prolapse. Fresh prolapse with healthy, viable tissue that is promptly reduced carries a fair to good prognosis. However, recurrence is common unless the underlying reproductive drive is controlled. Necrotic tissue or severely damaged oviduct requires surgery and carries a more guarded prognosis. Salpingohysterectomy, when successful, provides the best long-term outcome by eliminating future reproductive complications.
