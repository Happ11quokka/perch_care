# Egg Binding

## Overview

Egg binding is a common and potentially fatal reproductive emergency in which a female bird is unable to pass an egg within a normal time frame. In most parrot species, an egg should be laid within 24-48 hours of entering the oviduct. When the egg becomes stuck, it can compress nerves and blood vessels in the pelvis, leading to shock, organ damage, and death if not treated promptly. Egg binding is one of the most frequently seen avian emergencies and requires immediate veterinary intervention.

## Affected Species

All egg-laying parrot species are susceptible. Egg binding is particularly common in cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, and finches. Larger parrots such as macaws and cockatoos can also be affected. First-time layers, chronically laying hens, and small-bodied species are at highest risk.

## Causes

- **Calcium deficiency (hypocalcemia)**: The most common cause. Insufficient calcium weakens the oviductal muscles and can result in soft-shelled eggs that are difficult to pass.
- **Obesity**: Excess fat in the abdomen compresses the reproductive tract.
- **First-time layers**: Young or inexperienced hens may have difficulty passing their first egg.
- **Oversized or malformed eggs**: Abnormally large, double-yolked, or irregularly shaped eggs.
- **Soft-shelled eggs**: Eggs without adequate shell formation are difficult for the oviduct to grip and expel.
- **Lack of exercise**: Sedentary birds have weaker muscle tone.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Depletes calcium and exhausts the reproductive system.
- **Cold environment**: Low temperatures can reduce muscle function.
- **Oviductal disease**: Infection, scarring, or tumors of the oviduct.
- **Systemic illness**: Any concurrent illness reduces overall strength.

## Symptoms

- Straining or visible abdominal effort without producing an egg
- Sitting on the cage floor, often in a wide-legged stance
- Fluffed feathers and lethargy
- Tail bobbing (indicating respiratory distress from abdominal pressure)
- Decreased or absent droppings (egg compressing the cloaca)
- Swollen or distended abdomen
- Lameness or paralysis of one or both legs (egg compressing pelvic nerves)
- Loss of appetite
- Depression and weakness
- Sudden death in acute cases

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation of the abdomen may reveal a firm, egg-shaped mass. The vent area may be distended.
- **Radiographs**: Clearly show the presence, size, location, and shell quality of the retained egg.
- **Blood work**: Calcium levels (often critically low), complete blood count, and chemistry panel.
- **Cloacal examination**: May reveal the egg visible at the vent opening.

## Treatment

Egg binding is an emergency. Treatment escalates based on severity:

- **Warmth**: Place the bird in a warm (85-90F), humid environment. Heat relaxes smooth muscles and may help the bird pass the egg naturally.
- **Calcium supplementation**: Injectable calcium gluconate is administered to strengthen oviductal contractions. This is often the most critical intervention.
- **Lubrication**: Water-based lubricant applied to the vent may help passage.
- **Oxytocin or prostaglandin**: Hormones that stimulate oviductal contractions may be given by the veterinarian after calcium levels are corrected.
- **Ovocentesis**: If the egg is visible at the vent, the veterinarian may carefully puncture and collapse the egg for easier removal.
- **Manual extraction**: Gentle manual removal of the egg under sedation by an experienced avian veterinarian.
- **Surgical removal (salpingohysterectomy)**: In severe or recurrent cases, surgical removal of the egg and potentially the oviduct may be necessary.
- **Supportive care**: Intravenous or subcutaneous fluids, pain management (meloxicam), and nutritional support.

## Prevention

- **Adequate calcium**: Provide a calcium-rich diet including cuttlebone, mineral blocks, and calcium-fortified pellets. Supplement with calcium during laying periods.
- **Proper nutrition**: Feed a balanced diet with adequate vitamin D3 for calcium absorption.
- **UV lighting**: Full-spectrum UVB lighting helps birds synthesize vitamin D3 for calcium metabolism.
- **Discourage egg laying**: Reduce daylight hours to 10-12 hours, remove perceived nesting sites, avoid stroking the back or tail, and rearrange the cage environment.
- **Maintain healthy weight**: Prevent obesity through proper diet and exercise.
- **Hormone therapy**: For chronic layers, Lupron (leuprolide) or Deslorelin implants can suppress egg production.
- **Regular veterinary care**: Annual check-ups with blood calcium monitoring for laying hens.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is good when egg binding is recognized early and treated promptly. Birds that receive calcium and warmth often pass the egg within hours. Delayed treatment carries a poor prognosis, as prolonged egg retention can lead to shock, sepsis, oviductal rupture, and death. Recurrence is common in birds predisposed to egg binding, so addressing underlying causes is essential.
