# Egg Yolk Peritonitis

## Overview

Egg yolk peritonitis (also called egg-related coelomitis) is a serious and often life-threatening condition that occurs when egg yolk material enters the coelomic (abdominal) cavity instead of being captured by the oviductal infundibulum. Free yolk in the coelom triggers a severe inflammatory response and provides an ideal medium for bacterial growth, leading to infection, sepsis, and adhesion formation. This condition is considered a medical emergency and requires aggressive veterinary treatment. It is one of the most common causes of death in laying hens.

## Affected Species

All egg-laying parrot species are susceptible. Cockatiels, budgerigars, lovebirds, and cockatoos are most commonly affected. Any hen that is actively laying or has a history of chronic egg laying is at risk. The condition can also occur in birds that have never visibly laid eggs, as internal ovulation can still occur.

## Causes

- **Ectopic ovulation**: Yolk is released from the ovary but misses the infundibulum (the funnel-shaped opening of the oviduct), falling into the coelomic cavity.
- **Reverse peristalsis**: Abnormal oviductal contractions push yolk material back into the coelom.
- **Oviductal disease**: Infection, scarring, or tumors of the oviduct that impair normal egg capture.
- **Ruptured egg**: An egg breaks within the oviduct, releasing yolk into the coelom.
- **Chronic egg laying**: Repeated ovulation increases the likelihood of yolk material entering the coelom.
- **Salpingitis**: Infection of the oviduct can predispose to yolk leakage.
- **Ovarian cysts or tumors**: Abnormal ovarian tissue may release yolk erratically.

## Symptoms

- Distended, swollen abdomen (coelomic distension)
- Lethargy and depression
- Loss of appetite
- Difficulty breathing (fluid or yolk material compressing air sacs)
- Fluffed feathers
- Wide-legged stance or penguin-like posture
- Weight loss (despite appearing swollen)
- Decreased or absent droppings
- Tail bobbing (respiratory effort)
- Sudden collapse
- Signs of sepsis: fever, rapid breathing, severe depression

## Diagnosis

- **Physical examination**: Palpation reveals a distended, often fluid-filled coelom.
- **Radiographs**: Show coelomic distension with a ground-glass opacity. May reveal eggs or calcified material.
- **Ultrasound**: Can identify free fluid and yolk material in the coelom.
- **Coelomocentesis**: Aspiration of coelomic fluid for cytology and culture. Yolk peritonitis produces a characteristic yellow, thick fluid containing inflammatory cells and yolk granules.
- **Blood work**: Elevated white blood cells, elevated total protein, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood calcium may be elevated (hypercalcemia of active laying) or depleted.
- **CT scan**: Advanced imaging to assess the extent of disease and plan surgical approach.

## Treatment

Treatment is aggressive and often multimodal:

- **Stabilization**: Oxygen therapy, fluid therapy (IV or subcutaneous), and heat support.
- **Coelomocentesis**: Therapeutic drainage of fluid from the coelom to relieve respiratory compression. This provides immediate relief but is not curative.
- **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated immediately and adjusted based on culture results. Common choices include enrofloxacin combined with amoxicillin-clavulanate.
- **Anti-inflammatories**: Meloxicam for pain and inflammation.
- **Surgery (salpingohysterectomy)**: Surgical removal of the oviduct is the definitive treatment. During surgery, the coelom is lavaged to remove yolk material and adhesions. This also prevents future reproductive complications.
- **Hormone therapy**: Leuprolide (Lupron) or Deslorelin implant to suppress further ovulation, either as a bridge to surgery or as an alternative when surgery is not feasible.
- **Supportive care**: Nutritional support, pain management, and intensive monitoring.

## Prevention

- Discourage chronic egg laying through environmental management (reduced daylight, removal of nesting sites, dietary control).
- Consider hormone therapy (Lupron or Deslorelin) for hens with a history of reproductive problems.
- Discuss elective salpingohysterectomy with your avian veterinarian for high-risk hens.
- Provide adequate dietary calcium and balanced nutrition.
- Schedule regular veterinary examinations for laying hens.

## Prognosis

Prognosis is guarded to poor, depending on the severity and duration of the condition. Early detection with prompt medical and surgical intervention offers the best chance of survival. Birds that develop sepsis or extensive coelomic adhesions carry a poor prognosis. Surgical salpingohysterectomy provides the best long-term outcome by preventing recurrence, but avian reproductive surgery carries inherent risks. Without treatment, egg yolk peritonitis is usually fatal.
