# Handling Techniques

## Overview

Proper handling is a fundamental skill for any companion parrot owner. Good handling technique builds trust, ensures safety for both bird and handler, and facilitates daily care, grooming, veterinary visits, and emergency management. Poor handling -- rough grabbing, chasing, or forceful restraint -- creates fear, erodes trust, and is a primary cause of biting and handling aggression in companion parrots. This document covers safe, positive handling practices for routine care and when restraint is necessary.

## General Handling Principles

### Trust First
- Never handle a bird that does not trust you enough to accept basic interaction (accepting treats, tolerating your hand near it).
- Build handling tolerance gradually through positive reinforcement training (step-up, target training).
- Handling should be a positive or neutral experience, not a stressful one.

### Read Body Language
- Before attempting to handle a bird, assess its body language.
- **Receptive signs**: Relaxed posture, approaching you, feathers slightly fluffed, head lowered (requesting scratches).
- **Unreceptive signs**: Leaning away, feather slicking, eye pinning, growling, lunging, raised crest. Respect these signals and do not force interaction.

### Approach Technique
- Approach from the front and slightly below. Approaching from above or behind mimics a predator attack.
- Move slowly and deliberately. Rapid movements trigger fear.
- Speak calmly before and during handling.

## Routine Handling

### Step-Up
- The primary handling method. See step-up-command.md for detailed training.
- Offer your hand (or forearm for large birds) at lower chest level.
- Allow the bird to step up voluntarily on cue.

### Carrying
- When carrying a bird on your hand, hold your hand steady and move smoothly.
- Keep the bird at chest level, not above your head (birds may become dominant/territorial on high perches, and falling from a height is dangerous).
- Cup your other hand loosely around the bird's back for security if the bird seems unsteady, but do not grip.

### Head Scratching
- Many parrots enjoy head and neck scratches from trusted humans.
- Scratch against the direction of the feather growth to help loosen pin feather sheaths.
- **Only pet the head and neck.** Petting the back, wings, tail, or belly stimulates reproductive behavior (see hormonal-behavior.md).

### Returning to the Cage
- Use the "step down" command. Present a perch or the cage door perch and cue "step down."
- Do not toss or dump the bird into the cage.
- Always make returning to the cage a positive experience (offer a treat in the cage) so the bird does not associate being handled with being "put away."

## Towel Handling (Towel Restraint)

### When Toweling Is Necessary
- Veterinary examination and procedures.
- Nail trimming, beak care, or wing clipping.
- Emergency first aid (bleeding, injury).
- Medication administration.

### Towel Training (Proactive)
The best approach is to desensitize the bird to towels before they are needed:
1. Introduce the towel as a positive item: let the bird see, touch, and play with a towel (play peek-a-boo, drape it over a perch).
2. Click and treat for interacting with the towel.
3. Gradually shape tolerance: lightly touch the bird with the towel → drape the towel over the bird's back → wrap briefly.
4. Keep sessions positive and short.
5. A towel-trained bird experiences significantly less stress during veterinary visits.

### Proper Toweling Technique
1. Use a small, clean towel appropriate to the bird's size.
2. Approach calmly. Drape the towel over the bird from behind, covering the head.
3. Gently wrap the towel around the bird's body, securing the wings against the body.
4. **Hold the head securely but gently**: Position your thumb and index finger on either side of the head, just below the jaw. Do not squeeze the neck.
5. **Critical**: Never restrict chest movement. Birds breathe by expanding their chest (they have no diaphragm). Compressing the chest can cause suffocation.
6. Keep the feet controlled by wrapping them gently in the towel to prevent scratching.
7. Work quickly and calmly. Return the bird to its cage promptly after the procedure.
8. Offer a high-value treat immediately after release as a positive association.

### Toweling Safety
- **Never wrap so tightly that you restrict breathing.** Monitor the bird for labored breathing or open-mouth breathing during restraint.
- **Minimize restraint time.** Have all supplies ready before toweling.
- **Two-person technique**: One person restrains while the other performs the procedure. This is safer and faster.
- **Species consideration**: Large macaws and cockatoos may require a larger towel and more experienced handling. Small birds (budgerigars, cockatiels) are fragile and require extremely gentle pressure.

## Nail Trimming

- Overgrown nails can catch on fabric, toys, or cage bars, causing injury.
- Use sharp bird nail clippers or human nail clippers (for small birds).
- Trim only the tip, avoiding the quick (the blood vessel visible as a dark line in light-colored nails).
- Have styptic powder or cornstarch on hand in case of accidental bleeding.
- If the bird is clicker-trained, you can sometimes trim nails without toweling by clicking and treating for each nail.

## When Handling Goes Wrong

### If the Bird Bites
- Do not jerk your hand away (this can injure the bird and encourages biting).
- Stay still or gently push toward the bird (this is counterintuitive to the bird and it usually releases).
- Place the bird on the nearest stable surface and step back.
- Assess what triggered the bite and adjust your approach.

### If the Bird Panics
- Place the bird on the nearest safe surface (perch, cage top).
- Step back and give the bird space to calm down.
- Do not chase or attempt to recapture a panicking bird.
- Wait for the bird to settle, then re-approach slowly with an offered treat.
