# Children and Birds

## Overview

Companion parrots and children can develop wonderful relationships when interactions are properly supervised and both the child and the bird are taught appropriate behavior. However, parrots are not domesticated animals -- they retain wild instincts and can deliver serious bites -- and children's unpredictable movements and loud voices can frighten or provoke birds. Successful child-bird relationships require adult supervision, age-appropriate expectations, and education for both the child and proper management of the bird.

## Benefits of Children Growing Up with Birds

- **Empathy and responsibility**: Caring for a bird teaches children compassion, gentleness, and responsibility.
- **Education**: Children learn about biology, animal behavior, ecology, and conservation.
- **Emotional companionship**: Many children form deep bonds with their birds.
- **Patience**: Working with a bird teaches patience and reading non-verbal communication.

## Age-Appropriate Expectations

### Under 5 Years Old
- Children this age should **observe only** with direct adult supervision.
- They should not handle the bird.
- Teach "gentle voice" and "slow hands" around the bird.
- The bird's cage should be placed out of reach of unsupervised toddlers (risk of bitten fingers through cage bars).

### Ages 5-8
- Children can begin supervised, brief interactions with calm, well-socialized birds.
- An adult should be present for all handling.
- The child can offer treats through cage bars or on an open palm (no grabbing).
- Step-up can be taught with adult guidance if the bird is cooperative.
- Children can help with supervised cage cleaning, food preparation, and fresh water.

### Ages 8-12
- With proper education, children can participate more actively in bird care and handling.
- Supervised step-up and basic training sessions are appropriate.
- Children can take on routine care tasks (feeding, water changes) with adult oversight.
- This is a good age for teaching the child about body language reading.

### Ages 12+
- Responsible adolescents can handle well-socialized birds more independently.
- They can participate in training, enrichment creation, and daily care.
- Adult supervision is still advisable with large parrot species (macaws, cockatoos) due to bite risk.

## Safety Guidelines

### For the Child
- **Never leave a child unsupervised with a bird**, regardless of age or the bird's temperament. Birds can bite suddenly, and children can inadvertently harm birds.
- Teach children to:
  - Move slowly and speak softly around birds.
  - Never poke fingers through cage bars.
  - Never grab, squeeze, or chase the bird.
  - Recognize the bird's body language (leaning away = "leave me alone").
  - Respect the bird's "no" (if the bird moves away, do not follow).
  - Wash hands before and after handling.
- Explain that bites are the bird's way of communicating, not "being mean."
- If a child is bitten, remain calm. Overreacting reinforces the bird's use of biting and frightens both child and bird.

### For the Bird
- Ensure the bird has a safe retreat (cage with open door) it can escape to if overwhelmed.
- Do not force the bird to interact with children.
- Monitor for signs of stress: feather slicking, growling, retreating, eye pinning.
- Some individual birds are not suitable for households with young children due to temperament. Honest assessment is important.

## Species Considerations for Families with Children

### Generally More Suitable
- **Budgerigars**: Small, generally gentle, and even if they bite, they rarely cause significant injury. Good first birds for families.
- **Cockatiels**: Gentle temperament, small enough not to cause serious injury. Prone to night frights (educate children about quiet nighttime environment).
- **Green-cheeked Conures**: Playful and relatively gentle for a conure. Small enough for older children to handle.

### Requires More Caution
- **Lovebirds**: Can be nippy. Small beaks but capable of drawing blood.
- **Amazon Parrots**: Can be wonderful family birds but become dangerously aggressive during hormonal periods.
- **Senegal Parrots / Poicephalus species**: Some individuals bond to one person and may bite others.

### Higher Risk with Children
- **Macaws**: Extremely powerful beaks capable of crushing bone. A bite from a large macaw can require emergency medical attention. Generally not recommended for families with young children.
- **Cockatoos**: Powerful beaks, emotionally intense, and prone to unpredictable hormonal aggression. The combination of a cockatoo's need for attention and a child's unpredictability can be problematic.
- **Large Amazon Parrots**: Hormonal males can be extremely dangerous.

## Common Problems

### Bird Afraid of Children
- Children's unpredictable movements, high-pitched voices, and tendency to rush toward the bird are common fear triggers.
- **Solution**: Desensitization. Have the child sit quietly at a distance from the bird. The child can read aloud softly, play quietly, or offer treats from a distance. Gradually decrease distance as the bird becomes comfortable.

### Child Loses Interest
- The novelty of a bird may wear off, leaving the bird without adequate social interaction.
- **Solution**: Bird ownership is a family commitment, not the child's sole responsibility. Adults must ensure the bird's needs are met regardless of the child's interest level.

### Bird Bites Child
- Immediate first aid for the child (clean wound, bandage).
- Do not punish the bird. Identify what triggered the bite (fear, overstimulation, territorial) and adjust management.
- Evaluate whether the child-bird interaction plan needs modification.

## Teaching Children About Bird Care

- **Body language**: Teach children to read basic bird body language (fluffed = relaxed, slicked = scared, eye pinning = excited/agitated).
- **Consent**: Teach the concept that the bird gets to choose whether to interact. If it walks away, respect that.
- **Voice**: Practice "indoor voice" around the bird. Screaming escalates the bird's screaming.
- **Hygiene**: Always wash hands after handling (birds carry bacteria; children are more susceptible).
- **Food safety**: Teach which foods are safe and which are toxic for the bird.
