# Socializing a New Bird

## Overview

The socialization period when a new parrot first enters a home is one of the most critical phases in establishing a healthy, trusting relationship. How the first days and weeks are handled can shape the bird's behavior, confidence, and social temperament for years. Whether the bird is a hand-raised baby, a young adult, or a rehomed/rescue bird, a patient, structured approach to socialization is essential. Rushing this process is the most common mistake new parrot owners make and often leads to fear-based behavioral problems.

## The Adjustment Period

### First 24-48 Hours
- **Leave the bird alone in its cage** with food, water, and a quiet environment. Do not attempt to handle, train, or interact intensively.
- The bird needs time to orient to its new surroundings, find its food and water, and decompress from the stress of transport.
- Speak softly near the cage without direct interaction. Let the bird observe household activity from a safe distance.
- Monitor food and water intake -- ensure the bird is eating. Check droppings for signs of stress (watery, discolored).

### First Week
- Begin spending time near the cage, reading aloud, talking softly, or doing quiet activities.
- Offer treats through the cage bars (small pieces of food on a spoon or held between fingers at bar level).
- Let the bird set the pace. If it approaches the front of the cage with interest, that is a positive sign. If it retreats to the back, give more space.
- Maintain a consistent daily routine so the bird can predict meal times, interaction times, and quiet times.

### Weeks 2-4
- If the bird is approaching the cage bars and taking treats, begin offering treats with the cage door open.
- Allow the bird to come out of the cage voluntarily. Never reach in to grab.
- Begin step-up training (see step-up-command.md) if the bird is comfortable with your hand near it.
- Short, positive interaction sessions (5-10 minutes) are better than long, overwhelming ones.

### Month 2 and Beyond
- Gradually expand the bird's world: new rooms (supervised), new family members, varied experiences.
- Continue building the training foundation (step-up, target training, clicker training).
- Begin working on socialization with all family members (see below).

## Socializing with Multiple People

### Why Multi-Person Socialization Matters
- Birds that bond exclusively with one person can become aggressive toward other household members.
- A bird comfortable with multiple people is easier to care for, more adaptable, and less stressed when the primary caretaker is absent.
- All family members should participate in positive interactions, feeding, and training.

### Methods
- **Shared feeding**: Different family members take turns offering meals, treats, and fresh foods.
- **Shared training**: Multiple people practice the same cues and reward the same behaviors.
- **Parallel activity**: Family members spend time near the bird's cage doing neutral activities (reading, working on a laptop).
- **Avoid favoritism reinforcement**: If the bird only allows one person close, have that person present initially while others gradually build their own positive associations.

## Socializing Hand-Raised Babies

- Hand-raised babies are generally easier to socialize because they have positive associations with human hands and contact.
- However, they still need continued positive interaction to maintain tameness. A hand-raised baby that is neglected after purchase can become fearful.
- Expose the baby to a variety of people, environments, sounds, and experiences during the juvenile period (roughly equivalent to "socialization window" in puppies and kittens).
- This window is approximately the first 6-12 months of life, depending on species.

## Socializing Parent-Raised or Wild-Caught Birds

- Parent-raised birds and older birds with limited human contact require significantly more patience.
- Do not expect physical contact for weeks or even months.
- Begin with desensitization: simply being present near the bird without interaction.
- Use food motivation: the bird learns that your presence predicts good things (fresh food, treats).
- Target training at a distance (offering the target stick near the cage) can build interaction without requiring physical contact.
- Some wild-caught or parent-raised birds may never become "cuddly" but can learn to cooperate through training.

## Socializing Rescue/Rehomed Birds

### Special Considerations
- Rescue birds may have unknown histories of trauma, neglect, or abuse.
- Previous negative experiences with humans may manifest as fear, aggression, or extreme wariness.
- Do not assume a "one person bird" cannot learn to accept others -- it may just take much longer.

### Approach
- Move even more slowly than with a new baby. The bird may need weeks before it accepts treats from your hand.
- Avoid all confrontation. If the bird shows fear signals (retreating, eye pinning, growling), respect those signals and reduce pressure.
- Build positive associations consistently: every interaction should end positively.
- A rescue bird may regress during the adjustment period. This is normal. Patience and consistency are key.

## Veterinary Socialization

- Schedule a new-bird veterinary exam within the first 1-2 weeks.
- If possible, begin carrier training (see target-training.md) early so the bird is comfortable traveling to the veterinarian.
- Choose an avian veterinarian experienced with psittacines.
- The first veterinary visit includes a baseline physical exam, blood work, and disease screening.

## Signs of Successful Socialization

- The bird approaches the front of the cage when you enter the room.
- The bird accepts treats from your hand calmly.
- The bird steps up reliably without hesitation.
- The bird vocalizes normally (contact calls, babbling, singing).
- The bird preens and eats normally in your presence (these indicate comfort and security).
- The bird tolerates handling by multiple family members.

## Signs of Socialization Problems

- Persistent hiding at the back of the cage after 2+ weeks.
- Aggressive behavior (lunging, biting) that is not improving.
- Refusal to eat or significant weight loss.
- Excessive screaming or silence (complete silence is a stress indicator).
- Feather plucking or self-injury.
- Any of these warrant consultation with an avian veterinarian or certified avian behaviorist.
