# Birds and Other Pets

## Overview

Many parrot owners also keep other pets -- dogs, cats, ferrets, reptiles, or other birds. While interspecies friendships are sometimes portrayed positively on social media, the reality is that companion parrots are vulnerable prey animals, and most other common household pets are predators by nature. Even a "gentle" cat or dog retains predatory instincts that can be triggered by a bird's movement. The bacteria in cat and dog saliva is also highly dangerous to birds. Managing multi-species households requires constant vigilance, strict safety protocols, and realistic expectations about interspecies interactions.

## Fundamental Safety Principle

**Never leave a bird unsupervised with any other pet.** This is the single most important rule in multi-species households. Even a moment of inattention can result in a fatal attack. Supervised interaction does not mean the owner is in the same room; it means the owner is actively watching every interaction, ready to intervene instantly.

## Birds and Cats

### Risk Level: Very High

Cats are obligate predators with deeply ingrained hunting instincts specifically triggered by small, moving, feathered creatures. The risk to a bird from a cat is lethal.

### Dangers
- **Predatory attack**: Even well-fed, "lazy" indoor cats retain hunting instincts. A bird's fluttering movements trigger prey drive.
- **Bacterial infection**: **Pasteurella multocida**, a bacterium found in virtually all cat saliva, is rapidly fatal to birds. Even a minor scratch or bite from a cat, even one that does not appear to break the skin, can introduce Pasteurella and cause septicemia and death within 24-48 hours.
- **Stealth**: Cats are ambush predators. They can approach a cage silently and attack through the bars.
- **Stress**: A cat's presence near the cage, even without direct contact, causes chronic stress to the bird.

### Management
- Keep the bird's cage in a room the cat cannot access.
- Never allow the cat and bird to interact, even "supervised." The risk is not manageable.
- If the bird is out of its cage, the cat must be in a separate, closed room.
- Cage bars must be close enough together that the cat cannot reach through.
- If a cat scratches or bites a bird in any way, seek **emergency avian veterinary care immediately** -- the bird needs antibiotic treatment for Pasteurella exposure even if no wound is visible.

## Birds and Dogs

### Risk Level: High (varies by breed and individual)

Dogs' risk level varies more than cats, but all dogs should be considered potentially dangerous to birds.

### Dangers
- **Prey drive**: Many breeds (terriers, hounds, sporting breeds) have strong prey drives triggered by small, fast-moving animals.
- **Accidental injury**: Even a playful dog can injure or kill a bird with a paw swipe or by mouthing.
- **Bacterial infection**: Dog saliva also carries bacteria dangerous to birds, though the risk is lower than with cats.
- **Startle response**: A dog barking suddenly can trigger a night fright or panic response in the bird.

### Management
- Assess the individual dog's prey drive and temperament. Some dogs (particularly those bred for bird hunting) should never be in the same room as a bird.
- Initial introductions should have the bird safely in its cage and the dog on a leash.
- Obedience training: The dog must have reliable "leave it" and "down/stay" commands.
- Never allow the dog to put its mouth on the bird, even in "play."
- The bird should always have a safe retreat (cage) available.
- Some dog-bird households function safely with strict management, but the default should always be separation when unsupervised.

## Birds and Ferrets

### Risk Level: Extremely High

- Ferrets are obligate carnivores and skilled predators of small animals.
- They can fit through surprisingly small spaces and are persistent hunters.
- A ferret should **never** be in the same room as a bird, supervised or unsupervised.
- Even caged birds are at risk, as ferrets can manipulate cage doors and fit through bars.

## Birds and Reptiles

### Risk Level: Variable

- Large snakes: Obviously dangerous and should be housed in completely separate, secure enclosures.
- Lizards (bearded dragons, geckos): Generally low risk of direct predation, but bacterial cross-contamination (Salmonella) is a concern.
- Turtles/tortoises: Low direct risk, but hygiene considerations (Salmonella).
- **Cross-contamination**: Reptiles commonly carry Salmonella and other bacteria. Wash hands between handling reptiles and birds. Do not share water sources or feeding equipment.

## Birds and Other Birds

See multi-bird-household.md for detailed guidance. Key points:
- Size compatibility is critical.
- Same-species pairings are safest.
- Quarantine new birds for 30-45 days before introducing to existing birds.
- Even compatible birds should be supervised during interactions.

## Emergency Protocol

If another pet attacks a bird:
1. **Separate immediately** but safely (do not get bitten yourself).
2. **Assess injuries**: Check for puncture wounds, lacerations, broken bones, and breathing difficulties.
3. **Contact an avian veterinarian immediately**: Even if wounds appear minor, internal injuries and bacterial infection (especially from cat contact) can be fatal.
4. **Keep the bird warm and calm**: Place in a quiet, warm, dim environment during transport to the veterinarian.
5. **Antibiotics**: The veterinarian will likely start antibiotics immediately for any cat or dog contact, even without visible wounds.
6. **Time is critical**: Pasteurella infection from cat contact can kill within 24 hours. Do not "wait and see."

## Creating a Safe Multi-Species Household

- **Physical separation**: Default to complete physical separation between birds and predator species.
- **Secure cages**: Use cages with locks or clips that cannot be opened by cats or dogs. Ensure bar spacing prevents paw insertion.
- **Separate rooms**: When the bird is out of the cage, other pets should be in a different closed room.
- **Elevated placement**: Place bird cages high enough that dogs and cats cannot easily reach them (though cats can climb, so this alone is insufficient).
- **Door protocols**: All family members must follow strict door protocols when the bird is out.
- **Realistic expectations**: Accept that most interspecies interactions carry inherent risk. Cute social media videos of cats and birds "playing" represent extremely risky situations.
