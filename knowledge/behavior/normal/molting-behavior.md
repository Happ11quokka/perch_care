# Molting Behavior

## Overview

Molting is the natural process by which birds shed and replace their feathers. It is a physiologically demanding process that requires significant energy and nutritional resources, and it can affect a bird's behavior and temperament. Understanding normal molting patterns helps owners distinguish between healthy feather replacement and abnormal feather loss that may indicate illness or feather destructive behavior.

## The Molting Process

- **Frequency**: Most companion parrots undergo a complete molt **1-2 times per year**, typically triggered by changes in daylight length (photoperiod).
- **Duration**: A complete molt takes approximately **6-12 weeks**, with some species taking longer. Feathers are replaced gradually, not all at once, so the bird maintains flight ability throughout.
- **Pattern**: Feather replacement follows a symmetrical pattern -- matching feathers on both wings and tail are replaced simultaneously to maintain balanced flight.
- **Pin feathers**: New feathers emerge encased in a keratin sheath (pin feather or blood feather). These are sensitive and contain a blood supply until the feather is fully grown. Once mature, the sheath crumbles away.

## Normal Behavioral Changes During Molting

### Increased Irritability
- Molting birds may be more sensitive, cranky, or prone to biting. The physical discomfort of pin feathers (which are itchy and sensitive to touch) contributes to irritability.
- Be patient and gentle with a molting bird. Avoid unnecessary handling of areas with many pin feathers.

### Increased Preening
- Birds preen more frequently during molting to remove feather sheaths and maintain new feathers.
- Requesting head scratches more often is normal, as birds need help with pin feathers on the head and neck.

### Decreased Activity
- The physiological demands of feather production (protein, energy, calcium) can make birds less active and more subdued during heavy molting.
- Some birds may sleep more or be less interested in play.

### Appetite Changes
- Increased appetite is common and appropriate -- the bird needs more nutrients to support feather growth.
- Some birds may show decreased interest in food due to general discomfort, but this should not be prolonged.

### Vocal Changes
- Some birds vocalize less during heavy molting.
- Others may vocalize more due to discomfort or attention-seeking.

## Nutritional Support During Molting

- **Increase protein**: Feathers are approximately 90% keratin (a protein). Offer cooked eggs, legumes, and ensure adequate pellet intake.
- **Amino acids**: Methionine and lysine are critical for feather keratin production.
- **Vitamin A**: Supports feather pigmentation and quality.
- **Calcium**: Supports overall health during the physiological stress of molting.
- **Bathing**: Frequent misting or bathing helps soften pin feather sheaths, making them easier to remove, and soothes itchy skin.

## Normal vs. Abnormal Feather Loss

### Normal Molting
- Feathers fall out gradually and symmetrically.
- New pin feathers are visible where old feathers were lost.
- The bird appears slightly scruffy but not bald.
- No bare skin patches.
- Feathers that are shed are complete (with intact shaft and vanes).

### Abnormal Feather Loss (Requires Veterinary Evaluation)
- **Bare skin patches**: Visible bald areas, especially on the chest, belly, legs, or back.
- **No new growth**: Feather loss without pin feather replacement.
- **Damaged feathers**: Broken, chewed, or frayed feather shafts (suggesting self-destruction).
- **Head feather loss**: Since birds cannot reach their own heads, head feather loss usually indicates a medical condition (PBFD, mites, fungal infection) rather than self-plucking.
- **Excessive loss**: Losing large numbers of feathers rapidly or outside the normal molting season.
- **French molt**: A condition primarily in budgerigars where young birds lose flight and tail feathers and they fail to regrow normally. Associated with polyomavirus.

## Blood Feather Emergencies

- A broken **blood feather** (an actively growing pin feather with blood supply) can bleed profusely.
- **First aid**: Apply direct pressure with a clean cloth or cornstarch/styptic powder to the broken shaft. If bleeding does not stop within 5-10 minutes, the feather may need to be pulled (by grasping firmly at the base and pulling straight out in the direction of growth).
- **Seek veterinary attention** if bleeding is heavy or the feather cannot be managed at home.
