# Sleep Patterns & Requirements

## Overview

Adequate sleep is essential for the physical and psychological health of companion parrots. In the wild, most parrot species follow a diurnal pattern, becoming active at dawn and roosting at dusk. Captive parrots require 10-12 hours of uninterrupted sleep per night in a dark, quiet environment. Chronic sleep deprivation contributes to behavioral problems (irritability, screaming, biting), hormonal imbalances, immune suppression, and feather destructive behavior.

## Sleep Requirements

- **Duration**: Most companion parrots need **10-12 hours** of uninterrupted sleep per night.
- **Timing**: Should align with natural light cycles. Cover the cage or move the bird to a quiet sleep cage at a consistent time each evening.
- **Quality**: Sleep must be in darkness and relative quiet. Light exposure during sleep hours disrupts the natural circadian rhythm.

## Normal Sleep Behaviors

- **One-legged perching**: Birds commonly sleep standing on one leg with the other tucked into their belly feathers. This is normal and not a sign of injury.
- **Head tucked under wing**: Many species tuck their head under the wing or into the back feathers during deep sleep. This conserves heat.
- **Beak grinding**: Soft grinding of the beak often precedes sleep and is a sign of contentment.
- **Fluffed feathers**: Slight feather fluffing during sleep is normal (thermoregulation).
- **Eye closing during day**: Brief napping during the day is normal, especially after meals. However, a bird that sleeps excessively during the day may be ill.
- **Preferred sleeping spot**: Birds often have a preferred perch position for sleeping, typically the highest perch in the cage.

## Creating a Good Sleep Environment

### Darkness
- Cover the cage with a dark, breathable cage cover, or move the bird to a dedicated sleep cage in a dark, quiet room.
- Any light (TV, computer, nightlight) can disrupt sleep quality.
- Exception: Birds prone to night frights (cockatiels, budgerigars) may benefit from a very dim nightlight to reduce startling in complete darkness.

### Quiet
- Minimize household noise during sleep hours.
- Avoid placing the sleeping area near televisions, kitchens, or high-traffic rooms.
- Sudden loud noises can trigger night frights.

### Temperature
- Maintain comfortable room temperature (18-24°C / 65-75°F) during sleep.
- Avoid drafts from windows, doors, or air conditioning.

### Consistent Schedule
- Establish a consistent bedtime and wake time.
- Birds thrive on routine. Irregular schedules disrupt circadian rhythms and can trigger hormonal behavior.

## Sleep Cages

Many experienced bird owners use a separate "sleep cage" -- a smaller, simply furnished cage in a dark, quiet room specifically for sleeping:
- **Benefits**: Ensures undisturbed sleep regardless of household evening activities; provides a consistent, calm environment.
- **Setup**: A perch, water dish, and cage cover. No toys needed (toys can cause noise or entanglement in the dark).
- **Routine**: Transport the bird to the sleep cage at the same time each evening.

## Sleep Deprivation Effects

Chronic insufficient sleep can cause:
- **Increased irritability and aggression**: Sleep-deprived birds are more likely to bite and display territorial behavior.
- **Excessive screaming**: Overstimulated, tired birds vocalize more.
- **Hormonal behavior**: Extended light exposure (more than 12-14 hours) triggers reproductive hormones, leading to chronic egg-laying, territoriality, and aggression.
- **Feather destructive behavior**: Stress from sleep deprivation contributes to plucking.
- **Immune suppression**: Increased susceptibility to illness.
- **Decreased cognitive function**: Reduced ability to learn and interact positively.

## Napping

- Brief daytime naps (15-30 minutes) are normal, particularly after meals or during quiet afternoon periods.
- Excessive daytime sleeping (sleeping most of the day, sleeping on the cage floor) is abnormal and may indicate illness. Seek veterinary evaluation.

## Night Frights

- Some species (particularly cockatiels and budgerigars) are prone to **night frights** -- sudden panicked thrashing in the cage during darkness, often triggered by shadows, sounds, or vibrations.
- Prevention: A very dim nightlight, placing the cage away from windows, and maintaining a calm environment.
