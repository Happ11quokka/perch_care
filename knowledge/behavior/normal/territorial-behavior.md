# Territorial Behavior

## Overview

Territorial behavior is a natural instinct in companion parrots rooted in their wild survival needs to defend nesting sites, food sources, and mates. In captivity, territorial behavior most commonly manifests as cage aggression -- defending the cage and its immediate surroundings from perceived intruders, including the bird's own owner. Understanding territorial behavior helps owners manage it effectively and avoid inadvertently reinforcing aggressive territorial responses.

## Normal Territorial Behaviors

- **Cage guarding**: The bird may lunge, bite, or display aggressively when hands approach the inside of the cage. The cage is the bird's "nest" and personal space.
- **Food guarding**: Defending food dishes from other birds or from human hands.
- **Perch guarding**: Defending a favorite perch, playtop, or shoulder position.
- **Mate guarding**: Defending a bonded person or bird partner from perceived rivals.
- **Nest site defense**: Heightened during breeding season or if the bird has access to enclosed spaces (huts, boxes, dark corners) that simulate nesting cavities.

## Species Prone to Territorial Behavior

While all parrots can display territorial behavior, certain species are more prone:
- **Amazon parrots**: Among the most territorial, especially during hormonal periods. Can become dangerously aggressive around the cage.
- **Cockatoos**: Can be extremely territorial, particularly over their bonded person.
- **Macaws**: Territorial around cage and favorite person.
- **African Greys**: May become cage-territorial, especially as they mature.
- **Lovebirds**: Territorial despite their small size.

## Hormonal Intensification

Territorial behavior intensifies dramatically during hormonal (breeding) periods:
- **Triggers**: Extended daylight hours (>12 hours), warm temperatures, access to nesting material or cavities, high-fat diet, petting along the back/wings/tail.
- **Signs**: Increased cage aggression, eye pinning, feather display, lunging, biting, regurgitation on objects or people, paper shredding (nest building behavior).
- **Duration**: Typically seasonal but can become year-round if hormonal triggers are not managed.

## Management Strategies

### Respect the Territory
- **Ask the bird to step up away from the cage** rather than reaching into the cage. Use a perch or stick-training if the bird is cage-aggressive.
- Open the cage door and allow the bird to come out voluntarily.
- Change food and water when the bird is outside the cage when possible.

### Reduce Hormonal Triggers
- Maintain a light cycle of **10-12 hours of light and 12-14 hours of darkness**.
- Remove nesting material and enclosed spaces (huts, happy huts, boxes).
- Pet only on the head and neck. Avoid petting the back, wings, tail, and under the wings (these areas stimulate breeding behavior).
- Reduce high-fat, high-calorie foods during hormonal periods.

### Training-Based Approaches
- Practice step-up training in neutral locations (away from the cage).
- Use positive reinforcement to reward calm, non-aggressive behavior.
- Establish routines that the bird can predict, reducing defensive anxiety.
- Towel training and handling practice (when done positively) can help manage territorial handling challenges.

### Environmental Management
- **Multiple perching locations**: Provide playstands and perches in different areas so the bird is not always on or near the cage.
- **Rotate cage location**: Occasional changes in cage position can reduce territorial fixation (though some birds find this stressful -- know your individual bird).
- **Neutral territory for interaction**: Many territorial birds are much calmer when interacting away from their cage.

## When to Seek Help

- If territorial aggression causes injury to family members.
- If aggression is constant (not just seasonal/hormonal).
- If the bird becomes completely unhandleable around the cage.
- Consult an avian behaviorist or avian veterinarian for severe cases.
