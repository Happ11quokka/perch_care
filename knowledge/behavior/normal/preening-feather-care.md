# Preening & Feather Care

## Overview

Preening is one of the most important and time-consuming daily activities for companion parrots, occupying 30-50% of their waking hours. It is the bird's primary method of maintaining feather health, waterproofing, and overall hygiene. Understanding normal preening behavior helps owners distinguish between healthy feather care and the pathological feather-destructive behavior (plucking) that can indicate physical or psychological problems.

## Normal Preening Behaviors

### Feather Maintenance
- **Zipping**: Running individual feathers through the beak to realign the barbs and barbules (the microscopic hooks that hold feather vanes together). This restores the smooth, aerodynamic surface of each feather.
- **Cleaning**: Removing dirt, debris, dust, and old feather sheath material.
- **Oil distribution**: Birds possess a **uropygial (preen) gland** at the base of the tail. During preening, the bird touches its beak to this gland and distributes the oily secretion across its feathers. This oil waterproofs feathers, maintains flexibility, and contains precursors to vitamin D3 (which are converted by UVB light and then ingested during subsequent preening).

### Pin Feather Grooming
- **Pin feathers** (blood feathers) are new feathers still growing within a keratin sheath. They require careful grooming to remove the sheath as the feather matures.
- Birds often need help with pin feathers on the head and neck (areas they cannot reach themselves). Bonded birds preen each other's heads (allopreening), and many companion birds appreciate gentle assistance from their owner in removing head pin feather sheaths.

### Powder Down
- Certain species (cockatiels, cockatoos, African Greys) produce **powder down** -- specialized feathers that continuously disintegrate into a fine, white keratin powder.
- This powder helps waterproof feathers and gives the plumage a soft, dusty appearance.
- Powder production is normal and expected in these species but may require additional air filtration in the home.

## Allopreening (Mutual Preening)

- In the wild and captivity, bonded birds preen each other, focusing on the head, neck, and face -- areas a bird cannot reach alone.
- Allopreening strengthens pair bonds and social relationships.
- A bird that solicits head scratches from its owner (lowering its head, ruffling neck feathers) is requesting allopreening. This is a sign of trust and bonding.
- Owners should gently preen/scratch the head and neck, working with (not against) the feather growth direction.

## Bathing

- Bathing is an important complement to preening. Wet feathers are easier to preen, and bathing removes dust and debris.
- Most parrots enjoy bathing. Methods include:
  - Shallow dish of water in or near the cage
  - Gentle misting with a clean spray bottle (room temperature water)
  - Shower perch in the human shower (avoiding direct hot water or high-pressure spray)
  - Wet leafy greens (romaine lettuce, kale) placed in the cage -- some birds enjoy rolling in wet leaves
- **Frequency**: Offer bathing opportunities 2-4 times per week, or daily if the bird enjoys it.
- **No soap or products**: Never use soap, shampoo, or feather products on birds. Plain water is all that is needed.
- Allow the bird to air-dry in a warm, draft-free area after bathing.

## Signs of Normal vs. Abnormal Preening

### Normal Preening
- Smooth, deliberate movements through feathers
- Feathers appear clean, well-aligned, and intact after preening
- Occasional removal of old feather sheaths or loose down
- Preening occupies time but the bird also engages in other activities (playing, eating, socializing)

### Abnormal Preening / Feather Destructive Behavior
- Aggressive pulling, biting, or chewing of feathers beyond normal maintenance
- Broken, frayed, chewed, or missing feathers (especially on the chest, legs, back, or wings)
- Bare skin patches with healthy head feathers (birds cannot reach their own head, so head feathers remain intact in self-plucking)
- Feather loss beyond normal molting
- Obsessive, repetitive preening that dominates the bird's day
- Skin wounds or scabs from aggressive feather destruction

If abnormal preening is observed, consult an avian veterinarian to rule out medical causes (skin infections, internal disease, nutritional deficiency) before addressing behavioral factors.

## Supporting Healthy Feather Care

- Provide regular bathing opportunities.
- Ensure adequate UVB light for vitamin D3 synthesis (supports preen gland function and feather health).
- Feed a balanced diet rich in protein, vitamin A, and essential fatty acids for feather quality.
- Maintain appropriate humidity levels (40-60% relative humidity is ideal for most species).
- Assist with head and neck pin feathers when the bird requests it.
