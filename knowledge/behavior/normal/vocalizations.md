# Vocalizations & Communication

## Overview

Vocalizations are a primary mode of communication for companion parrots. In the wild, parrots use calls to maintain flock cohesion, signal danger, establish territory, attract mates, and communicate emotional states. In captivity, birds continue these natural vocal behaviors and adapt them to their human "flock." Understanding the meaning behind different vocalizations helps owners respond appropriately and strengthens the bird-human bond.

## Types of Vocalizations

### Contact Calls
- **Purpose**: To locate flock members and maintain social bonds. The avian equivalent of "Where are you? I'm here!"
- **Sound**: Species-specific. Ranges from a budgerigar's chirp to a cockatoo's loud screech.
- **Normal frequency**: Morning and evening contact calls are normal and expected. Birds call when they hear their owner moving in another room.
- **Response**: Briefly calling back or verbally responding ("I'm here!") satisfies the contact call need. Ignoring contact calls can increase calling frequency and volume.

### Alarm Calls
- **Purpose**: To alert flock members to perceived danger.
- **Sound**: Sharp, loud, urgent-sounding screams or screeches, distinctly different in tone from contact calls.
- **Triggers**: Unfamiliar people or animals, sudden movements, loud noises, perceived predators (hawks or planes seen through windows).
- **Response**: Investigate the cause calmly. Acknowledge the bird's concern verbally in a soothing tone.

### Happy/Content Vocalizations
- **Singing, whistling, chattering**: Relaxed vocalizations indicating contentment. Many parrots "sing" to themselves when happy.
- **Soft murmuring or babbling**: Often heard when the bird is resting or settling down. May include practice of words or sounds.
- **Purring (low growling)**: Some species produce a soft, low rumbling when content (especially Amazon parrots and African Greys). Context matters -- this sound can also indicate displeasure in some situations.

### Morning and Evening Calls
- **Dawn and dusk calling**: Most parrot species are naturally more vocal at dawn and dusk, corresponding to peak activity times in the wild.
- This is genetically programmed behavior and cannot be eliminated. Duration of 10-20 minutes is typical and normal.
- Owners should plan around these natural vocal periods rather than trying to suppress them.

### Talking and Mimicry
- **Speech**: Some species are exceptional mimics (African Greys, Amazon parrots, Eclectus). They learn words and phrases from their environment.
- **Context speech**: Advanced talkers may use words in appropriate contexts ("hello" when someone enters, "want grape" when hungry).
- **Sound mimicry**: Birds mimic telephones, doorbells, microwave beeps, other pet sounds, and human laughter.
- **Practice speech**: Birds often quietly practice new words and sounds when alone, gradually refining their accuracy.

### Beak Grinding
- While technically not a vocalization, the soft grinding sound of beak on beak is a normal contentment signal, typically heard as the bird settles to sleep.

## Loud vs. Problem Vocalizations

### Normal Volume (Expected)
- Contact calls at morning/evening
- Excited vocalizations during play
- Alarm calls in response to genuine startling events
- Species-appropriate calling (cockatoos and macaws are naturally louder than cockatiels and budgies)

### Problem Volume (See problematic/excessive-screaming.md)
- Continuous, prolonged screaming beyond normal contact calling
- Screaming that escalates when owner responds by yelling back
- Screaming driven by boredom, attention-seeking, or anxiety
- Volume that represents a significant change from the bird's established baseline

## Species-Specific Vocal Characteristics

| Species | Noise Level | Talking Ability | Notable Sounds |
|---------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Budgerigar | Low | Moderate (fast, squeaky) | Chattering, chirping |
| Cockatiel | Low-Moderate | Low | Whistling (males excel), contact calls |
| Lovebird | Moderate | Very low | High-pitched chirping, chattering |
| Conure (Sun, Jenday) | High | Low-Moderate | Loud screeching |
| Conure (Green-cheek) | Moderate | Low | Quieter than other conures |
| African Grey | Moderate | Excellent | Wide vocabulary, sound mimicry |
| Amazon Parrot | High | Very good | Singing, opera-like calls, loud |
| Cockatoo | Very High | Moderate | Extremely loud screams, talking |
| Macaw | Very High | Moderate | Deep, resonant calls |
| Eclectus | Moderate | Good | Melodic calls, clear speech |

## Communication Tips for Owners

- Learn to distinguish your bird's different call types.
- Respond to contact calls briefly to prevent escalation.
- Never yell at or punish a bird for vocalizing -- this reinforces the behavior.
- Reward quiet behavior and pleasant vocalizations with attention.
- Provide adequate stimulation to reduce boredom-driven calling.
