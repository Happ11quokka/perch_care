# Trick Training

## Overview

Trick training teaches companion parrots to perform specific behaviors on cue for positive reinforcement. While tricks may seem purely entertaining, they serve important functions: they provide mental stimulation, strengthen the human-bird bond, increase the bird's confidence, and give the bird a constructive way to interact with its environment. Trick training is built on the foundation of positive reinforcement, clicker training, and target training, and virtually any parrot species can learn tricks with patience and appropriate methods.

## Benefits of Trick Training

- **Mental stimulation**: Learning new behaviors engages the bird's cognitive abilities and prevents boredom.
- **Physical exercise**: Many tricks involve movement (turning, waving, flapping) that provides exercise.
- **Confidence building**: Successfully performing behaviors and earning rewards builds the bird's self-assurance.
- **Bond strengthening**: Training sessions are quality time that deepens the human-bird relationship.
- **Behavioral outlets**: Tricks give the bird appropriate ways to earn attention and rewards, reducing problem behaviors.
- **Socialization tool**: A bird that performs tricks may be more positively received by visitors, increasing its social interactions.

## Foundation Skills (Prerequisites)

Before attempting tricks, ensure the bird has:
1. **Clicker/marker charging**: The bird understands that click = treat.
2. **Target training**: The bird reliably touches a target stick with its beak.
3. **Step-up**: The bird steps onto the hand on cue.
4. **Trust**: The bird is comfortable with the trainer and training environment.

## Common Tricks and Training Methods

### Wave
- **Final behavior**: Bird lifts one foot and moves it in a waving motion on cue.
- **Method**: Begin with step-up. Present your hand as if asking for step-up, but hold it just out of reach. The bird will lift its foot to step. Click and treat the foot lift. Gradually shape for a higher, more exaggerated lift. Add the verbal cue "wave" and a hand-wave visual cue.

### Turn Around (Spin)
- **Final behavior**: Bird rotates 360 degrees on a perch.
- **Method**: Use target training. Lure the bird in a circle by moving the target stick around it. Click and treat for following the target through a quarter turn, then half turn, then full turn. Fade the target and add a verbal cue "turn around" or hand signal.

### Eagle (Wings Spread)
- **Final behavior**: Bird spreads both wings on cue.
- **Method**: Capture or shape. Many birds naturally stretch their wings. Click and treat when this happens. If shaping, use a target above the bird to encourage looking up and raising wings. Add cue "eagle" or "big bird."

### Shake Hands
- **Final behavior**: Bird extends one foot and gently grips the trainer's finger.
- **Method**: Similar to wave training. Present a finger near the bird's foot. Click and treat for any foot contact with the finger. Shape toward a gentle grip. Add cue "shake."

### Nod Yes / Shake Head No
- **Final behavior**: Bird moves head up and down (yes) or side to side (no) on cue.
- **Method**: Use target training. For "yes," move the target up and down; the bird follows with its head. Click and treat for head bobbing. For "no," move the target left and right. Add verbal cues.

### Retrieve/Fetch
- **Final behavior**: Bird picks up an object and brings it to the trainer or drops it in a container.
- **Method**: Shape in steps: (1) touch the object, (2) pick up the object, (3) hold the object, (4) carry the object, (5) drop the object in a target container. Each step is shaped and reinforced independently before combining.

### Play Dead (Lie on Back)
- **Final behavior**: Bird rolls onto its back in the trainer's hand and remains still.
- **Method**: Advanced trick requiring high trust. Begin by cupping the bird in your hands and very gradually tilting it back. Click and treat for tolerance at each angle. Progress very slowly over many sessions. Some birds will never be comfortable with this and it should not be forced.

### Basketball/Ring Toss
- **Final behavior**: Bird picks up a small ball and drops it through a miniature hoop, or picks up a ring and places it on a peg.
- **Method**: Break into components: pick up object, carry object, drop object at target location. Use target training and shaping for each component.

## Training Tips

### Session Structure
- Keep sessions **5-10 minutes** maximum.
- End on a success -- even if you need to ask for an easy behavior the bird knows well.
- 2-3 short sessions per day are more effective than one long session.
- Train one new trick at a time to avoid confusion.

### Shaping Criteria
- Raise criteria gradually. If the bird successfully performs a step 80% of the time, it is ready for the next step.
- If the bird becomes confused or frustrated (refusing, biting, walking away), go back to the previous step.
- Each step should be small and achievable.

### Motivation Management
- Train before meals when the bird is slightly hungry (not starving).
- Use high-value treats reserved only for training.
- If using seeds/nuts as treats, account for the caloric intake in the bird's daily diet.
- Vary the reinforcement -- sometimes a head scratch, verbal praise, or play can supplement food rewards.

### Fading and Maintenance
- Once a trick is learned on cue, gradually transition from continuous reinforcement (reward every time) to variable reinforcement (reward unpredictably).
- Variable reinforcement actually strengthens behavior (the "slot machine effect").
- Practice learned tricks periodically to maintain them.

## Species Considerations

- **Large parrots** (macaws, cockatoos, Amazons): Can learn complex tricks involving large objects and physical movements.
- **Medium parrots** (African Greys, conures, Eclectus): Often excel at cognitive tricks (color matching, counting, puzzle solving).
- **Small parrots** (budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds): Learn well but require smaller props and more delicate handling. Budgerigars can learn impressive repertoires.
