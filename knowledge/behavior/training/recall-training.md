# Recall Training (Flight Training)

## Overview

Recall training teaches a companion parrot to fly to the trainer on cue. It is one of the most advanced and rewarding training behaviors, providing the bird with critical exercise, mental stimulation, and strengthened trust with the handler. Recall training also serves a practical safety function -- a bird with a reliable recall is less likely to be lost in an escape situation. However, recall training requires careful progression, a safe environment, and a strong foundation in basic training (step-up, target training, clicker training) before beginning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting recall training, the bird should:
- Have a reliable step-up on cue.
- Be comfortable with clicker/marker training.
- Have target training basics established.
- Be fully flighted (unclipped wing feathers) or have wings grown back sufficiently for controlled flight.
- Be healthy and at a good weight (consult avian veterinarian).
- Have a strong bond with the trainer.

## Safety First

### Indoor Training Only (Initially)
- **Always train indoors** in a bird-safe room with windows and doors closed.
- Cover mirrors and large windows (birds may fly into glass).
- Turn off ceiling fans.
- Remove other pets from the room.
- Block access to kitchens, open water, and other hazards.

### Outdoor Recall
- Outdoor recall training is extremely advanced and carries the risk of permanent loss.
- Even well-trained birds can be spooked by wind, predators, or unfamiliar stimuli and fly away.
- If pursuing outdoor recall, use a **flight harness or aviator harness** as a safety line during early outdoor training.
- Consider a GPS tracker on the harness for additional safety.
- Many experienced trainers recommend never flying unrestrained outdoors.

## Training Steps

### Step 1: Short Distance Recall
1. With the bird on a perch, stand very close (arm's length away).
2. Present your hand (step-up position) and say your recall cue ("come" or a specific whistle).
3. The bird should step or hop onto your hand.
4. Click and treat with a high-value reward.
5. This is essentially a close-range step-up with a specific recall cue.

### Step 2: Increase Distance Gradually
1. Move one step away from the perch. Present your hand and give the recall cue.
2. The bird may lean forward, hop, or make a short flight to reach your hand.
3. Click and treat immediately upon landing on your hand.
4. If the bird hesitates, move closer. Never rush distance increases.
5. Gradually increase distance by one step at a time over multiple sessions.

### Step 3: Cross-Room Recall
1. Once the bird reliably flies 3-4 feet, begin calling from across the room.
2. Use the recall cue and present your hand (a clear visual target).
3. Click and treat for each successful recall.
4. Practice from different positions and directions in the room.

### Step 4: Multi-Room Recall (Advanced)
1. Call from a different room (the bird must fly through a doorway).
2. Start with the bird being able to see you, then progress to calling from out of sight.
3. This requires a very strong training foundation and high motivation.

### Step 5: Add Distractions
1. Practice with mild distractions present (household activity, TV on, other people).
2. Gradually increase distraction level.
3. The recall cue should become so well reinforced that it overrides distractions.

## The Recall Cue

- Choose a specific, distinct cue used only for recall (not general conversation).
- A specific whistle works well because it carries over distance and is distinct.
- The cue should be positively charged through consistent reinforcement -- every recall earns a reward.
- **Never use the recall cue to call the bird for something unpleasant** (cage, nail trimming, veterinary visit). This poisons the cue.

## Benefits of Recall Training

- **Exercise**: Flying is the most natural and effective form of exercise for birds. Even short flights significantly improve cardiovascular health.
- **Mental stimulation**: The decision-making involved in flight (navigation, landing, responding to cues) is mentally enriching.
- **Confidence building**: Successful flight builds the bird's confidence and sense of agency.
- **Bond strengthening**: The bird choosing to fly to you is a powerful trust indicator.
- **Safety**: A bird that comes when called is safer in escape or emergency situations.
- **Weight management**: Regular flight helps prevent obesity.

## Wing Clipping Considerations

- Recall training requires the bird to have functional flight feathers.
- Birds with clipped wings cannot be recall trained until feathers regrow.
- The decision to clip or not clip is personal and should consider the individual bird, household environment, and risk factors.
- If transitioning from clipped to flighted, the bird may need to relearn flight skills gradually, as muscle tone and coordination have atrophied.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bird won't leave the perch | Decrease distance, increase treat value, ensure the bird is slightly hungry |
| Bird flies to you but crashes/misses | The bird may lack flight fitness; start with very short distances and build flight muscle gradually |
| Bird flies away instead of to you | Training environment has too many distractions or the bird is not sufficiently motivated; simplify |
| Bird recalls inconsistently | Increase reinforcement value; ensure the cue is always followed by reward |
| Bird lands on head/shoulder instead of hand | Hold your hand higher and more prominently; reward only hand landings |
