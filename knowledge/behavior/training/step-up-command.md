# Step-Up Command

## Overview

The step-up command is the single most important behavior for any companion parrot to learn. "Step up" means the bird steps from one surface (perch, cage top, table) onto the trainer's offered hand, finger, or arm on cue. A reliable step-up is essential for safe handling, transport, veterinary visits, and daily interactions. It is the primary way owners move their birds and is foundational for building trust and cooperation. Every companion parrot, regardless of species or size, should be trained to step up reliably using positive reinforcement.

## Why Step-Up Is Essential

- **Safety**: Allows quick, calm retrieval in emergencies (open windows, toxic exposure, pet encounters).
- **Daily handling**: The most-used command for moving the bird in and out of the cage, to and from play areas.
- **Veterinary care**: A bird that steps up cooperatively is easier to examine and less stressed at the clinic.
- **Trust building**: A positive step-up experience builds the bird's confidence in the handler.
- **Preventing biting**: A structured step-up reduces the bird's need to bite to communicate (e.g., instead of reaching into the cage and getting bitten, the bird steps up voluntarily at the door).

## Training Method

### Prerequisites
- A charged clicker or verbal marker (see clicker-training.md).
- High-value treats.
- A calm, quiet environment.
- The bird should be on a perch or playstand (not inside the cage -- cage territoriality can interfere).

### Step 1: Hand Familiarization
1. If the bird is fearful of hands, begin by simply placing your hand near the bird (not touching) and offering a treat.
2. Click and treat for calm behavior in the presence of your hand.
3. Gradually move your hand closer over multiple sessions until the bird is comfortable with your hand near its body.

### Step 2: Offer the Hand
1. Present your hand (or forearm for larger birds) at the bird's lower chest/belly level, just above the feet. The hand should approach from slightly below and in front -- never from above (mimics predator attack).
2. Hold the hand steady. Do not push against the bird's chest.
3. Some birds will step onto the hand naturally out of curiosity.
4. **Click and treat immediately** when the bird places even one foot on your hand.

### Step 3: Complete Step-Up
1. Once the bird is placing one foot consistently, wait for both feet before clicking.
2. Add the verbal cue "step up" just before presenting your hand. Say it once, clearly, in a neutral (not commanding) tone.
3. Click and treat when the bird steps up on cue.

### Step 4: Duration and Movement
1. Gradually increase the time the bird stays on your hand before clicking and treating.
2. Begin moving slowly with the bird on your hand (walking a few steps).
3. Click and treat for remaining calm while being moved.

### Step 5: Generalize
1. Practice step-up from different surfaces (cage top, playstand, couch, table).
2. Practice with different family members.
3. Practice in different rooms and contexts.

## The "Step Down" Command

Teaching "step down" (stepping from the hand onto a surface) is equally important:
1. Present a perch or surface at the bird's chest level.
2. Say "step down" and gently position the bird near the surface.
3. Click and treat when the bird steps off your hand onto the surface.
4. Never toss, shake, or dump the bird off your hand.

## Common Mistakes

### Forcing the Step-Up
- Pushing the hand into the bird's chest to force it to step up ("laddering") is an outdated technique that creates fear and resistance.
- The bird should choose to step up for the reward, not be physically pushed.

### Chasing the Bird
- If the bird retreats, do not pursue. Remove your hand and try again later.
- Chasing creates a predator-prey dynamic.

### Inconsistent Cue
- Use the same cue word and hand position every time.
- All family members should use the same cue.

### Punishing Refusal
- If the bird does not step up, simply remove the hand, wait, and try again.
- Never punish, withhold food, or force the bird.

### Reaching Into the Cage
- Many bites happen when owners reach into the cage to get the bird. Open the door and present the step-up at the doorway, or allow the bird to come out first.

## Species-Specific Considerations

- **Large macaws and cockatoos**: Use the forearm rather than fingers/hand due to the bird's size and weight. Ensure your arm is sturdy enough to support the bird comfortably.
- **Small birds (budgerigars, cockatiels)**: A single finger or two fingers may serve as the perch. Approach gently -- small birds may be more hand-shy.
- **African Greys**: May prefer to step up from a stable surface onto the hand rather than from a wobbly surface. Patient, slow approach is key.
- **Amazon Parrots**: During hormonal periods, step-up may need to be done with a handheld perch rather than the bare hand to avoid hormonal aggression.

## When the Bird Refuses

- **Not hungry**: Training before meals increases motivation.
- **Cage territorial**: Try outside the cage in a neutral location.
- **Fearful**: Go back to hand familiarization steps.
- **Hormonal**: Use a handheld perch as an intermediate step.
- **Pain/illness**: A bird that suddenly refuses step-up may be in pain -- consider veterinary evaluation.
- **Distracted**: Reduce environmental distractions.
