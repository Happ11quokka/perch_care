# Target Training

## Overview

Target training is one of the most versatile and foundational training techniques for companion parrots. The bird is taught to touch a specific object (the "target") -- usually the end of a stick, chopstick, or wooden dowel -- with its beak. Once the bird understands targeting, the target can be used to guide the bird to specific locations, onto scales, into carriers, through obstacles, and into positions for other behaviors. Target training is often the first behavior taught after charging the clicker because it is intuitive for parrots (they naturally explore objects with their beaks) and provides a clear, achievable behavior that builds training confidence.

## Why Target Training Is Important

- **Foundation behavior**: Opens the door to teaching many other behaviors.
- **Movement guidance**: Directs the bird's movement without physical handling.
- **Reduces fear**: Gives the bird a familiar, positive task to focus on in new or potentially scary situations.
- **Veterinary cooperation**: Can be used to position the bird for examinations and procedures.
- **Carrier/crate training**: Guides the bird into carriers voluntarily.
- **Weight management**: Guides the bird onto a scale for regular weighing.
- **Recall**: Extended targeting can transition into recall training.

## Equipment

- **Target stick**: A chopstick, wooden dowel, or commercially available target stick. Many trainers prefer a stick with a distinct colored tip (small ball or bead) to give the bird a clear visual endpoint.
- **Clicker** (or verbal marker): See clicker-training.md.
- **Treats**: Small, high-value food treats.

## Training Steps

### Step 1: Present the Target
1. Hold the target stick a few inches from the bird, at beak level.
2. Most parrots will naturally investigate the unfamiliar object by reaching toward it or touching it with their beak.
3. **Click and treat** the instant the bird's beak makes contact with the target.
4. Remove the target briefly, then present it again.
5. Repeat until the bird reliably touches the target each time it is presented.

### Step 2: Add Distance
1. Present the target slightly farther away so the bird must lean or take a step to touch it.
2. Click and treat for contact.
3. Gradually increase the distance so the bird walks, climbs, or flies short distances to reach the target.
4. Build distance slowly -- if the bird stops responding, you have progressed too quickly.

### Step 3: Add Direction
1. Present the target in different positions -- left, right, above, below.
2. Click and treat for touching the target regardless of position.
3. This teaches the bird to follow the target wherever it goes.

### Step 4: Add the Cue
1. Once the bird reliably follows and touches the target, add a verbal cue (e.g., "touch" or "target") just before presenting the stick.
2. Over time, the bird associates the verbal cue with the expected behavior.
3. Click and treat only when the bird touches the target after the cue.

### Step 5: Generalize
1. Practice in different locations (different rooms, on different perches, outside the cage).
2. Practice with different people presenting the target.
3. Gradually increase environmental complexity (more distractions).

## Applications

### Guiding to a Scale
- Place the target near the scale.
- Guide the bird onto the scale by moving the target.
- Click and treat when the bird stands on the scale.
- Over time, the bird will step onto the scale voluntarily.

### Carrier Training
- Place the target at the carrier entrance, then progressively deeper inside.
- Click and treat each time the bird follows the target into the carrier.
- Build duration (bird remains in carrier) before closing the door.

### Veterinary Cooperation
- Target the bird to hold still in positions useful for examination.
- Target to an offered hand for step-up at the veterinary clinic.
- Provides a familiar, calming task in a stressful environment.

### Station Training
- Teach the bird to go to a specific location (perch, stand, designated spot) by placing the target at the station.
- Fade the target as the bird learns to go to the station on cue.

### Foundation for Trick Training
- Targeting is the basis for many tricks: spin (follow target in a circle), wave (target above the foot), eagle (target to spread wings), and many more.
- See trick-training.md for applications.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Bird is afraid of the target stick | Use a shorter stick, present it at a distance, click and treat for looking at it, gradually move closer |
| Bird bites the target hard | This is fine initially; shape gentler touches over time by clicking for softer contact |
| Bird loses interest | Keep sessions short (3-5 minutes), use higher-value treats |
| Bird follows your hand, not the target | Keep your treat hand behind your back until after the click |
| Bird only targets in one location | Practice in multiple locations to generalize the behavior |
