# Toy Types & Rotation

## Overview

Toys are essential tools for maintaining the mental and physical health of companion parrots. In the wild, parrots spend their days engaged in complex activities -- foraging, socializing, exploring, and manipulating objects in their environment. In captivity, toys serve as substitutes for these natural activities, providing opportunities for chewing, shredding, problem-solving, physical exercise, and comfort. A variety of toy types, regularly rotated to maintain novelty, is critical for preventing boredom and associated behavioral problems.

## Categories of Bird Toys

### Destructible (Chewing/Shredding) Toys
- **Purpose**: Satisfies the natural urge to chew, gnaw, and destroy materials (which parrots do constantly with bark, branches, and food items in the wild).
- **Materials**: Softwood (balsa, pine, yucca), palm fronds, coconut husk, paper, cardboard, leather (vegetable-tanned only), sisal, cork.
- **Species matching**: Soft woods for small birds, harder woods for large birds with powerful beaks.
- **Importance**: Arguably the most important category. If a parrot only has one type of toy, it should be destructible.
- **Replacement**: These toys are meant to be destroyed. Replace when consumed.

### Foraging Toys
- **Purpose**: Provides foraging enrichment by requiring the bird to work to access food.
- **Types**: Puzzle boxes, acrylic foraging toys, shreddable foraging items, treat-dispensing toys.
- **See**: foraging-opportunities.md for detailed foraging information.

### Foot Toys
- **Purpose**: Small toys the bird holds in its foot and manipulates. Encourages dexterity and independent play.
- **Examples**: Small wooden blocks, wiffle balls, beads on rings, small braided rope toys, plastic bottle caps (bird-safe).
- **Species**: Particularly enjoyed by conures, African Greys, Amazons, and other species that use their feet dexterously.

### Puzzle/Interactive Toys
- **Purpose**: Cognitive stimulation. The bird must figure out how to manipulate the toy to access a reward or solve a problem.
- **Types**: Sliding puzzles, stacking rings, nut-and-bolt toys (bird must unscrew to access treat), multi-step toys.
- **Best for**: Highly intelligent species (African Greys, cockatoos, macaws) that need intellectual challenge.

### Preening Toys
- **Purpose**: Provides appropriate preening texture for birds that over-preen or pluck. Redirects the preening instinct to a toy.
- **Materials**: Cotton rope, sisal rope, leather strips, palm fronds.
- **Important for**: Birds with feather destructive behavior tendencies.
- **Safety note**: Trim frayed rope ends regularly to prevent toe/neck entanglement.

### Noise-Making Toys
- **Purpose**: Auditory stimulation and interactive play. Birds enjoy toys that produce sounds in response to their manipulation.
- **Types**: Bells (safe, enclosed bells -- not jingle bells with small openings that can trap toes), rattle toys, toy xylophones.
- **Safety**: Ensure bells do not have clappers that can be swallowed and that the bell opening cannot trap the bird's toe or beak.

### Swings and Boings
- **Purpose**: Physical exercise and balance. Birds enjoy swinging and bouncing.
- **Types**: Traditional swings, spiral boings (coiled rope or wire springs), rope swings.
- **Benefits**: Exercise, proprioceptive stimulation, fun.

### Comfort/Snuggle Toys
- **Purpose**: Provides tactile comfort, particularly for birds that seek physical contact.
- **Types**: Soft rope knots, small plush toys (for birds that don't shred and ingest them).
- **Caution**: Remove if the bird ingests fabric. Do NOT use happy huts, snuggle tents, or enclosed fabric structures -- these stimulate nesting behavior and pose entanglement/ingestion hazards.

## Toy Safety

### Safe Materials
- Untreated natural wood (bird-safe species)
- Vegetable-tanned leather
- Stainless steel hardware
- Natural sisal, hemp, jute, and cotton rope
- Food-grade acrylic and plastic
- Coconut shell
- Bird-safe dyes (vegetable or food-grade dyes)

### Dangerous Materials and Features
- **Zinc-plated hardware**: Quick-links, chains, and clips with zinc coating are toxic. Use stainless steel.
- **Lead**: Some weights and soldered components contain lead.
- **Jingle bells with slot openings**: Toes and beaks can become trapped.
- **Thin chains**: Can catch toes and create strangulation risk. Use only welded chain with appropriately sized links.
- **Cotton rope (when frayed)**: Long fibers can wrap around toes, legs, or neck. Trim regularly.
- **Happy huts/snuggle tents**: Ingestion of fabric causes crop impaction. Enclosed design stimulates hormonal behavior. Generally not recommended.
- **Mirrors**: Controversial. Some birds develop obsessive behavior with mirrors, treating their reflection as a mate. May contribute to hormonal behavior. Use with caution and monitor.
- **Small parts**: Any part that can be broken off and swallowed (if small enough to pass through the bird's beak, it can be ingested).

## Toy Rotation Strategy

### Why Rotate
- Birds habituate to familiar toys, reducing their enrichment value.
- Novel toys stimulate curiosity and engagement.
- Rotation makes a limited toy collection last longer and feel "new."

### How to Rotate
1. Keep 3-5 toys in the cage at a time (adjust based on cage size).
2. Have a reserve collection of toys outside the cage.
3. Every 1-2 weeks, swap 1-2 toys from the cage with toys from the reserve.
4. When reintroducing a toy the bird hasn't seen for a few weeks, it will often engage with it as if it were new.
5. Add new toys to the reserve collection regularly.

### Exception: Favorite Toys
- Some birds have a strong attachment to a specific toy ("security toy"). This toy should remain in the cage permanently.
- Removing a comfort toy can cause stress and anxiety.

## Species-Specific Toy Preferences

- **Cockatoos**: Powerful chewers needing large, hard-wood destructible toys. Also enjoy puzzle toys.
- **Macaws**: Need the largest, most durable toys. Enjoy foot toys and large puzzle toys.
- **African Greys**: Prefer puzzle and foraging toys that challenge their intelligence. Some are cautious with new toys (neophobia).
- **Amazon Parrots**: Enjoy foot toys and noisy toys. Active players.
- **Conures**: Enthusiastic players that enjoy swings, bells, and foot toys.
- **Cockatiels**: Prefer smaller toys, bells, and swings. Often cautious with new items.
- **Budgerigars**: Enjoy bells, mirrors (with caution), small swings, and shredding toys.
- **Lovebirds**: Enthusiastic shredders. Provide ample paper and soft wood toys.

## Budget-Friendly Toy Ideas

- Paper towel and toilet paper rolls (untreated cardboard)
- Plain paper for shredding
- Popsicle sticks (untreated)
- Plastic bottle caps (bird-safe plastic)
- Small cardboard boxes
- Untreated wicker baskets
- Pine cones (washed and baked at 100°C/200°F for 20 minutes to sanitize)
- Wooden clothespins (no metal spring)
