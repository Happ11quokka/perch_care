# Bathing & Water Play

## Overview

Bathing is an essential behavior for companion parrots that supports feather health, skin condition, and psychological well-being. In the wild, parrots bathe regularly in rain, streams, and dew-covered vegetation. Bathing helps maintain feather condition by removing dust, dander, and debris; softens pin feather sheaths during molting; moisturizes dry skin; and provides enrichment and sensory stimulation. Most companion parrots enjoy bathing in some form, though individual preferences for bathing method vary widely.

## Benefits of Bathing

### Feather and Skin Health
- Removes accumulated dust, dander, and feather debris (particularly important for powder-down species like cockatoos, African Greys, and cockatiels).
- Moisturizes feathers and skin, preventing dryness that contributes to itching and feather plucking.
- Softens pin feather sheaths during molting, making them easier to remove through preening.
- Encourages normal preening behavior after bathing.

### Behavioral Benefits
- Provides enrichment and sensory stimulation.
- Bathing is often a social activity -- many birds enjoy bathing when their owners are nearby or bathing themselves.
- Post-bath preening occupies the bird constructively for extended periods.
- Regular bathing can reduce feather destructive behavior in some birds.

### Respiratory Health
- Misting increases humidity in the bird's immediate environment, benefiting respiratory health, especially in dry indoor environments.
- Helps clear nasal passages and sinuses of dust.

## Bathing Methods

### Misting/Spraying
- **Method**: Use a clean spray bottle set to a fine mist. Spray above the bird and let the mist settle down like rain.
- **Pros**: Easy, controlled, works well for birds that enjoy rain-like bathing.
- **Cons**: Some birds dislike the spray sensation. Do not spray directly in the face.
- **Water**: Room temperature to slightly warm. Never use cold or hot water.
- **Tips**: Spray in an arc above the bird, not directly at it. Let the bird choose to move into or away from the mist.

### Shallow Dish Bathing
- **Method**: Provide a shallow dish (pie plate, baking dish, or specialized bird bath) with about 2-3 cm (1 inch) of water.
- **Pros**: Allows the bird to control its own bathing experience. Many birds love splashing in shallow water.
- **Cons**: Can be messy. Water should be fresh and changed if soiled.
- **Tips**: Place the dish on a towel or in an area that can get wet. Lukewarm water. Some birds prefer the dish placed on the cage floor; others prefer it at perch level.

### Shower Bathing
- **Method**: Take the bird into the shower using a shower perch (suction-cup perch attached to the shower wall).
- **Pros**: Provides a rain-like experience. Social -- the bird bathes with its human. Good for thorough soaking.
- **Cons**: Requires shower perch. Water temperature must be carefully controlled (not too hot). Ensure the bird can choose to be in or out of the water stream.
- **Water temperature**: Lukewarm. Test on your wrist. Never use hot water.
- **Tips**: Position the perch so the bird can move into and out of the water stream. Do not use soap or shampoo on the bird.

### Wet Leaf Bathing
- **Method**: Provide wet leafy greens (romaine lettuce, kale, Swiss chard) for the bird to roll in and rub against.
- **Pros**: Mimics natural bathing in wet vegetation. Provides enrichment. Safe for reluctant bathers.
- **Cons**: Less thorough than other methods.
- **Tips**: Wash greens thoroughly and wet them generously. Place on a plate or hang in the cage.

### Sink/Faucet Bathing
- **Method**: Some birds enjoy bathing under a gentle stream from a kitchen or bathroom faucet.
- **Pros**: Running water appeals to many birds.
- **Cons**: Requires supervision. Temperature control is critical. Ensure the sink is clean and free of soap residue.

## Bathing Frequency

- **General recommendation**: Offer bathing opportunities 2-3 times per week minimum.
- **Powder-down species** (cockatoos, African Greys, cockatiels): May benefit from more frequent bathing (daily misting) due to heavy powder production.
- **During molting**: Increase bathing frequency to help soften pin feather sheaths.
- **Dry environments**: More frequent bathing in heated homes during winter or in arid climates.
- **Individual preference**: Some birds want to bathe daily; others are less enthusiastic. Offer regularly and let the bird choose.

## Bathing Safety

### Water Temperature
- **Lukewarm only** (approximately body temperature or slightly below). Test on your wrist.
- Never use hot water (risk of burns).
- Very cold water can cause chill, especially in small birds.

### Drying
- Allow the bird to dry naturally in a warm, draft-free room.
- Birds will preen extensively after bathing, which is normal and important for feather alignment.
- **Do NOT use a hair dryer on high heat** -- the hot air can burn skin and there is a risk of Teflon-coated heating elements emitting toxic fumes in some dryers. A low-heat, Teflon-free dryer at a distance is acceptable for birds that tolerate it, but natural drying is preferred.
- Ensure the room is warm enough (at least 20°C / 68°F) and draft-free during drying.

### Timing
- Bathe early in the day so the bird has time to dry completely before sleeping.
- A wet bird sleeping in a cool room risks hypothermia.

### Products
- **Never use soap, shampoo, or any cleaning products** on the bird. Plain water only.
- Feather-conditioning sprays (aloe-based, avian-specific) are available but generally unnecessary for healthy birds. Consult your avian veterinarian before using any product.

## Birds That Dislike Bathing

- Some birds are reluctant to bathe, often due to lack of exposure during early development.
- **Strategies**: Try different bathing methods (a bird that dislikes misting may love a shallow dish). Offer wet greens. Place a bathing dish near the bird and let it investigate at its own pace. Bathe in front of the bird to model the behavior.
- **Never force bathing**: Forced misting creates fear and negative associations.
- Even hesitant bathers can often be gradually acclimated with patience and positive experiences.
