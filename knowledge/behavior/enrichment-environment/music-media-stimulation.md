# Music & Media Stimulation

## Overview

Auditory and visual stimulation through music, television, radio, and other media can provide enrichment for companion parrots, particularly when human interaction is limited (such as when owners are at work). Parrots are highly auditory and vocal animals that naturally live in rich soundscapes, and appropriate media exposure can reduce loneliness, provide background stimulation, and even inspire vocal learning. However, the type, volume, and duration of media exposure matters -- not all media is appropriate, and overexposure can be stressful.

## Music

### Benefits
- Music can have a calming effect on birds, reducing stress indicators during alone time.
- Many birds actively engage with music -- bobbing, swaying, vocalizing, and dancing.
- Musical exposure provides auditory enrichment and may inspire new vocalizations and songs.
- Calm music can help soothe anxious or stressed birds.

### What Types of Music Do Birds Prefer?
Research and owner observations suggest:
- **Classical music**: Many birds respond positively to classical music, particularly orchestral pieces at moderate tempo. Studies have shown reduced stress indicators in birds exposed to classical music.
- **Soft pop and acoustic music**: Gentle, melodic music is generally well-received.
- **Nature sounds**: Recordings of forest sounds, gentle rain, or wild bird calls can provide comforting background.
- **Music they grew up with**: Birds exposed to specific genres from a young age often prefer those genres.
- **Individual preference**: Like humans, individual birds have distinct preferences. Observe your bird's reaction to different genres.

### Music to Avoid
- **Heavy metal, hard rock, or aggressive music**: Loud, discordant music with heavy bass can stress birds.
- **Very high-volume music**: Birds have sensitive hearing. Keep volume at a conversational level.
- **Music with sudden loud sections**: Startling volume changes can trigger fear responses.

### How to Use Music
- Play music at a moderate volume (conversational level or quieter).
- Observe the bird's response: positive signs include relaxed body language, head bobbing, singing along. Negative signs include feather slicking, retreating, or alarm calls.
- Provide periods of silence. Constant background noise without quiet periods can be stressful.
- Use a timer to turn music on during alone time and off during quiet/sleep periods.

## Television and Video

### Potential Benefits
- Provides visual and auditory stimulation during alone time.
- Some birds enjoy watching nature programs (particularly those featuring other birds).
- Moving images and changing sounds prevent monotonous silence.

### Considerations
- **Content matters**: Nature documentaries, calm programming, and shows with varied sounds are generally best.
- **Avoid**: Violent content, horror, action movies with explosions and screaming, or anything with sudden loud noises.
- **Screen brightness**: Position the TV so the bird is not staring directly at a bright screen at close range.
- **Not a substitute for interaction**: Television should supplement, never replace, direct human interaction.

### Bird-Specific Videos
- Some companies produce videos designed specifically for birds (featuring close-up footage of other birds, natural environments, or calming scenery).
- Some birds become very engaged with these videos, though others show little interest.
- Monitor the bird's response -- some birds may become frustrated or stressed by seeing birds they cannot interact with.

## Radio and Podcasts

- Radio provides varied auditory stimulation (music, talking, different voices) that can reduce isolation.
- Talk radio or podcasts expose the bird to human speech patterns, which may encourage vocal learning.
- NPR-style calm programming is often recommended for birds left alone.
- Avoid stations with frequent, loud commercials or aggressive talk formats.

## Environmental Sounds

### Natural Sound Machines
- Sound machines playing gentle nature sounds (rain, forest, ocean) can provide calming background.
- Useful for birds in noisy urban environments to mask jarring external sounds.

### Household Sounds
- Normal household activity sounds (kitchen sounds, conversation, gentle music) provide natural background that most birds find comforting.
- Complete silence is unnatural for flock animals and can increase anxiety.

## Volume and Duration Guidelines

- **Volume**: Keep all media at or below conversational volume. Birds have far more sensitive hearing than humans. If you need to raise your voice to speak over the media, it is too loud.
- **Duration**: Provide media enrichment in blocks (2-3 hours), not continuously all day. Include periods of quiet.
- **Sleep time**: All media must be turned off during the bird's 10-12 hours of sleep. Light and sound from TVs and radios disrupt sleep quality.
- **Variety**: Alternate between different types of media and silence to provide varied enrichment.

## Observing Your Bird's Response

| Response | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| Head bobbing, dancing | Enjoyment, engagement |
| Singing, whistling along | Active participation, positive |
| Relaxed posture, soft eyes | Calm contentment |
| Feather slicking, retreating | Stress -- change or turn off media |
| Alarm calls, wing flapping | Fear or agitation -- turn off immediately |
| Complete ignoring | Neutral -- the media is not providing enrichment |
