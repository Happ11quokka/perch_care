# Aviary Design

## Overview

An aviary is a large, enclosed structure that provides companion parrots with a spacious living environment far exceeding what a traditional cage can offer. Aviaries allow flight, natural movement, exposure to outdoor conditions (for outdoor aviaries), and enhanced environmental enrichment. They range from small indoor flight cages to large outdoor walk-in structures. While not every parrot owner has the space or resources for an aviary, understanding aviary design principles can help owners optimize whatever space they have and consider aviaries as an option for providing the best possible quality of life for their birds.

## Types of Aviaries

### Indoor Flight Cage
- A large cage (typically 1.5-3 meters / 5-10 feet long) that allows short flights within the home.
- Suitable for apartments or homes where outdoor aviaries are not feasible.
- Provides significantly more space than a standard cage.
- Can be commercially purchased or custom-built.

### Outdoor Aviary
- A walk-in structure typically constructed of wood and wire mesh, placed in a garden or yard.
- Provides natural sunlight, fresh air, and environmental stimulation.
- Requires weather protection and predator-proofing.
- Can range from modest (2x2x2 meters) to very large structures.

### Mixed Indoor/Outdoor Aviary
- A structure that connects an indoor area (climate-controlled) with an outdoor area through an access hatch or tunnel.
- Gives the bird the choice of indoor or outdoor environments.
- Ideal setup but requires significant planning and construction.

### Suspended Aviary
- Elevated aviary enclosure that does not rest on the ground, reducing ground predator access and vermin.
- Common in breeding facilities but adaptable for companion birds.

## Design Principles

### Size
- **Length is more important than height** for flight. Birds fly horizontally, not vertically. An aviary should be long enough to allow at least several wing beats of sustained flight.
- **Minimum recommended size** for a single medium parrot (conure to Amazon size): 2m x 1m x 2m (L x W x H) / approximately 6 x 3 x 6 feet.
- **For large parrots** (macaws, cockatoos): 3m+ x 1.5m+ x 2m+ / 10+ x 5+ x 6+ feet.
- Larger is always better. If space permits, build as large as possible.

### Materials

#### Wire Mesh
- **Galvanized after welding (GAW)**: Preferred for outdoor aviaries. The zinc coating provides corrosion resistance.
- **Stainless steel mesh**: The best but most expensive option. No toxicity concerns, extremely durable.
- **PVC-coated wire**: Provides weather protection but may be chewed off by large parrots.
- **Avoid**: Galvanized before welding (GBW) wire has exposed zinc at weld points. Lead-soldered connections are toxic.
- **Wire gauge**: Must be sturdy enough that the species cannot bend or break it. Large macaws and cockatoos require heavy-gauge wire (minimum 12-gauge).
- **Mesh spacing**: Same guidelines as cage bar spacing (see cage-setup-design.md).

#### Frame
- **Aluminum**: Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, non-toxic. Excellent choice.
- **Steel**: Strong but requires weather-proof coating.
- **Treated wood**: Use only bird-safe treated wood for the frame. Do not use CCA (chromated copper arsenate) treated timber. Hardwoods (oak, cedar) are more rot-resistant than softwoods.
- **Avoid**: Pressure-treated pine with old-style chemical treatments (contains arsenic and chromium).

### Roofing
- At least a portion of the aviary should have a solid roof for rain and sun protection.
- Materials: Polycarbonate sheeting (UV-transparent), corrugated roofing, shade cloth.
- Partial open mesh roof allows rain bathing (which many birds enjoy) while the covered section provides shelter.

### Flooring
- **Concrete**: Easy to clean, prevents predator digging, durable. Can be uncomfortable for birds to walk on -- provide natural ground cover in areas.
- **Gravel over concrete**: Good drainage and natural appearance.
- **Natural earth/grass**: Aesthetically pleasing but difficult to clean and may harbor parasites and bacteria. Not recommended if wild birds can access the area.
- **Wire mesh floor** (suspended aviaries): Must be smooth to prevent foot injuries.

## Environmental Features

### Perching
- Provide natural branches at various heights, angles, and diameters.
- Use bird-safe native tree species.
- Include horizontal perches for resting and vertical/diagonal branches for climbing.
- Position perches to allow flight paths between them (do not clutter the flight space).

### Vegetation
- **Bird-safe plants** can be incorporated for enrichment, shade, and natural appearance: hibiscus, bamboo palm, spider plant, Boston fern, safe grasses.
- Be aware that parrots will destroy most vegetation. Use sturdy, non-toxic species and be prepared to replace them.
- Avoid all toxic plants (see toxic-plants.md).
- Live plants improve humidity and air quality.

### Shelter
- A sheltered area (enclosed section or wind-protected corner) for protection from wind, rain, and extreme temperatures.
- Roosting boxes or sheltered perching areas for sleeping.
- In cold climates, an insulated shelter or heated section is essential.

### Water Features
- A shallow bird bath or misting system provides bathing opportunities.
- A dripping water source attracts many birds and encourages drinking and bathing.
- Ensure water is fresh and clean; stagnant water breeds bacteria and mosquitoes.

### Enrichment
- Incorporate foraging stations, destructible wood pieces, hanging toys, and climbing structures.
- Rotate enrichment items regularly.
- Natural elements (safe branches to chew, pine cones, dried flowers) provide natural enrichment.

## Safety Considerations

### Predator Protection
- **Double-door entry** (airlock style): Two doors that are never open simultaneously to prevent escape.
- **Buried wire mesh**: Extend wire mesh 30-60 cm (12-24 inches) underground around the perimeter to prevent digging predators (foxes, rats, snakes).
- **Roof security**: Fully enclosed roof to prevent aerial predators and climbing predators (cats, raccoons).
- **Lock security**: Padlocks on all doors and access points (raccoons can open simple latches).
- **Visual barriers**: Solid panels on lower sections prevent ground-level predator visibility, reducing stress.

### Weather Protection
- **Shade**: Essential in warm climates. At least 50% of the aviary should be shaded.
- **Wind protection**: Solid walls on the prevailing wind side.
- **Heating**: In cold climates, provide a heated shelter or bring birds indoors during extreme cold.
- **Temperature monitoring**: Outdoor thermometer to track conditions.

### Escape Prevention
- Inspect the aviary regularly for gaps, rust, or damage.
- Ensure all mesh connections are secure.
- Double-door entry system is critical.
- Train a recall before allowing birds in a large aviary.

### Hygiene
- Regular cleaning of perches, food stations, and floors.
- Prevent wild bird access to food and water sources (wild birds carry diseases).
- Remove decaying food and organic matter promptly.
- Disinfect periodically with bird-safe cleaners.
