# Foraging Opportunities

## Overview

In the wild, parrots spend 4-8 hours per day (40-75% of their waking hours) foraging for food -- searching, selecting, manipulating, and processing food items. In captivity, food is typically provided in easily accessible bowls, and the bird can consume its entire daily intake in as little as 20-30 minutes. This leaves hours of unoccupied time that would naturally be spent foraging, leading to boredom, frustration, and behavioral problems. Providing foraging opportunities is one of the most impactful enrichment strategies for companion parrots, addressing natural behavioral needs and significantly improving psychological well-being.

## Why Foraging Matters

- **Behavioral need**: Foraging is a deeply ingrained instinct. The motivation to forage exists regardless of hunger level.
- **Mental stimulation**: Foraging requires problem-solving, decision-making, and physical manipulation, engaging the bird's cognitive abilities.
- **Reduces problem behaviors**: Boredom-related problems (feather plucking, excessive screaming, stereotypic behaviors) are significantly reduced when foraging opportunities are provided.
- **Extends feeding time**: Spreading food intake over hours rather than minutes is more natural and healthy.
- **Physical exercise**: Foraging involves climbing, reaching, tearing, and manipulating objects.
- **Weight management**: Working for food burns more calories than eating from a bowl.

## Foraging Difficulty Levels

### Level 1: Beginner (Bird New to Foraging)
- **Visible food, easy access**: The bird can see the food and access it with minimal effort.
- Examples: Scatter food on a paper plate, place food in an open paper cup, put treats on top of crumpled paper in a dish.
- The bird learns that food can be found in unexpected places.

### Level 2: Intermediate
- **Visible food, moderate manipulation required**: The bird can see the food but must work to access it.
- Examples: Food wrapped loosely in paper, food in a small paper bag, food pushed through cage bars onto a platform the bird must reach.
- Commercial foraging toys with clear windows that show the food inside.

### Level 3: Advanced
- **Hidden food, problem-solving required**: The bird cannot see the food and must search and/or solve a puzzle to access it.
- Examples: Food hidden inside a paper towel roll with folded ends, food inside a cardboard box with holes, commercial puzzle foraging toys.
- Multiple-step foraging challenges.

### Level 4: Expert
- **Complex puzzles and multi-step challenges**: Advanced foraging toys requiring multiple steps, tool use, or sequential problem-solving.
- Examples: Stacking puzzle toys, drawers that must be opened, levers that must be manipulated, layered foraging systems.

## Foraging Ideas

### DIY Foraging
- **Paper wraps**: Wrap treats in small pieces of paper or cupcake liners.
- **Paper cups**: Place food in a paper cup, fold the top over.
- **Paper towel rolls**: Stuff with treats and fold the ends closed.
- **Cardboard boxes**: Small boxes with holes cut for access (ensure no staples, glue, or printing ink).
- **Shreddable items**: Food hidden among strips of paper, palm fronds, or bird-safe wood.
- **Foraging trays**: A shallow tray filled with clean pebbles, wooden beads, or crumpled paper with food hidden among them.
- **Skewers**: Thread fresh vegetables and fruits on a stainless steel skewer (bird-safe, no sharp ends).
- **Paper bags**: Small lunch bags with treats inside, hung from the cage bars.

### Commercial Foraging Toys
- **Acrylic puzzle toys**: Clear containers the bird must figure out how to open.
- **Bamboo foraging traps**: Natural bamboo containers with access points.
- **Foraging wheels**: Rotating toys where the bird must manipulate compartments.
- **Piñata-style toys**: Woven or wrapped toys the bird must destroy to access food.
- **Foraging boxes with drawers**: Small wooden drawer systems.

### Environmental Foraging
- **Scatter feeding**: Instead of using a food bowl, scatter pellets and dried foods across a foraging tray or flat surface in the cage.
- **Multiple feeding stations**: Place small amounts of food in several locations throughout the cage instead of one large bowl.
- **Hanging food**: Hang leafy greens, corn cobs, or food skewers at various heights.
- **Foraging trees**: A tabletop tree stand with food items attached at different points.

## Species Considerations

- **Large parrots (macaws, cockatoos)**: Need sturdy foraging toys that withstand powerful beaks. Acrylic and stainless steel components. Large nuts in shells.
- **Medium parrots (African Greys, Amazons, conures)**: Variety of difficulty levels. African Greys often excel at puzzle toys.
- **Small parrots (budgerigars, cockatiels, lovebirds)**: Smaller toys appropriate for their beak size. Millet sprays tucked into paper bundles. Mini foraging toys.
- **Lorikeets**: Nectar-based foraging (brushes with nectar, flowers with nectar inside).

## Foraging Safety

- Use only bird-safe materials: unbleached paper, vegetable-tanned leather, bird-safe wood, stainless steel, food-grade acrylic.
- Avoid: Printed newspaper (ink toxicity), treated wood, rubber bands, string that can be ingested, sharp metal edges, toxic glues.
- Supervise the first use of any new foraging toy to ensure the bird interacts safely.
- Remove and replace foraging toys that are damaged or have exposed sharp edges.
- Do not rely solely on foraging for nutrition -- always ensure the bird has adequate access to its regular diet. Foraging supplements, not replaces, standard feeding.

## Implementation Tips

- **Start easy**: If the bird has never foraged, begin with Level 1 and progress gradually.
- **Let the bird watch**: If the bird is hesitant, let it watch you hide food in the toy or container.
- **Mix familiar and new**: Hide familiar favorite foods in foraging toys to build initial motivation.
- **Rotate foraging toys**: Change toys regularly to maintain novelty and interest.
- **Forage across settings**: Provide foraging opportunities both inside and outside the cage.
