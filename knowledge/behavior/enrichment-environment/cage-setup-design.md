# Cage Setup & Design

## Overview

The cage is a companion parrot's primary living space -- its home, bedroom, dining room, and safe haven. Proper cage selection and setup are fundamental to the bird's physical health, psychological well-being, and behavioral development. An appropriately sized, well-designed cage with proper furnishings prevents boredom, reduces stress, supports natural behaviors, and helps prevent common problems such as feather plucking, obesity, and foot disorders. This document covers cage selection, placement, and interior design to create an optimal living environment.

## Cage Size Guidelines

### The Bigger, the Better
- The cage should be the largest you can accommodate and afford. No cage is "too big."
- Minimum cage size: The bird should be able to fully extend its wings in all directions without touching the bars, and have room to climb, play, and move between multiple perches.

### Minimum Size Recommendations by Species

| Species | Minimum Cage Size (W x D x H) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Budgerigar | 45 x 45 x 60 cm (18 x 18 x 24 in) |
| Cockatiel | 60 x 45 x 60 cm (24 x 18 x 24 in) |
| Lovebird | 45 x 45 x 60 cm (18 x 18 x 24 in) |
| Conure | 60 x 60 x 90 cm (24 x 24 x 36 in) |
| African Grey | 90 x 60 x 120 cm (36 x 24 x 48 in) |
| Amazon Parrot | 90 x 60 x 120 cm (36 x 24 x 48 in) |
| Cockatoo | 90 x 60 x 150 cm (36 x 24 x 60 in) |
| Macaw | 120 x 90 x 150 cm (48 x 36 x 60 in) |

**Note**: These are absolute minimums. Most avian professionals recommend significantly larger cages, especially for birds that spend extended periods caged.

### Bar Spacing

| Bird Size | Appropriate Bar Spacing |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Small (budgerigar, lovebird, parrotlet) | 1-1.3 cm (3/8 - 1/2 in) |
| Medium (cockatiel, conure, Senegal) | 1.3-2 cm (1/2 - 3/4 in) |
| Large (African Grey, Amazon, small cockatoo) | 2-2.5 cm (3/4 - 1 in) |
| Extra-large (macaw, large cockatoo) | 2.5-3.8 cm (1 - 1.5 in) |

Bar spacing that is too wide allows small birds to escape or get their heads trapped. Bar spacing that is too narrow prevents climbing for larger birds.

### Bar Orientation
- Horizontal bars (or a combination of horizontal and vertical) allow climbing.
- Vertical-only bars make climbing difficult for parrots.

## Cage Material Safety

### Safe Materials
- **Stainless steel**: The gold standard. Non-toxic, durable, easy to clean, does not chip or rust.
- **Powder-coated steel**: Acceptable if the coating is intact. Inspect regularly for chipping.
- **Wrought iron**: Acceptable if powder-coated or painted with bird-safe finish.

### Dangerous Materials
- **Zinc-coated (galvanized) metal**: Zinc is toxic to birds. Galvanized wire can cause zinc poisoning.
- **Lead-based solder or paint**: Highly toxic.
- **Brass**: May contain zinc or lead.
- **Bamboo or wooden cages**: Cannot be adequately sanitized, can harbor bacteria and fungi, and will be destroyed by chewing.

## Cage Placement

### Ideal Placement
- **Social area**: Living room or family room where the bird can observe and participate in household activities.
- **Against a wall**: Having one or two sides against a wall provides a sense of security (the bird does not feel exposed from all directions).
- **Eye level or slightly below**: This provides comfortable interaction without the bird being in a dominant position.
- **Good lighting**: Near (but not directly in front of) a window for natural light exposure. Ensure part of the cage remains shaded so the bird can escape direct sunlight.

### Locations to Avoid
- **Kitchen**: Fumes from nonstick cookware (PTFE/Teflon), aerosol sprays, smoke, and cooking vapors are toxic and potentially fatal to birds.
- **Bathroom**: Humidity fluctuations, chemical fumes, open water hazards.
- **Drafty areas**: Near doors, windows with poor insulation, air conditioning vents, or heating ducts.
- **Isolated rooms**: Social deprivation from being in a room where no one goes.
- **Direct sunlight**: Full sun exposure without shade option can cause heatstroke.
- **Near loud electronics**: Chronic noise stress.

## Interior Setup

### Perches
- **Variety is essential**: Provide 3-5 perches of different materials and diameters.
- **Natural wood branches**: Varying diameter exercises foot muscles and prevents pressure sores. Safe wood species include manzanita, java wood, eucalyptus, apple, and willow.
- **Rope perches**: Flexible, comfortable for sleeping. Trim frayed ends to prevent toe entanglement.
- **Concrete/mineral perches**: One concrete perch helps maintain nail and beak condition. Place it where the bird does not spend extended time (not the sleeping perch).
- **Avoid dowel perches**: Uniform-diameter dowel perches do not exercise feet and contribute to pressure sores (bumblefoot).
- **Perch placement**: Position perches at different heights and angles. Ensure the bird can move between perches without fouling food/water dishes. Place the highest perch as the sleeping spot.

### Food and Water
- **Minimum two food dishes**: One for pellets/dry food, one for fresh foods.
- **Separate water dish**: Placed away from food dishes to prevent contamination.
- **Dish placement**: Not directly below perches (to prevent fecal contamination).
- **Stainless steel dishes**: Easiest to sanitize. Ceramic is also acceptable.
- **Dish access from outside**: Externally accessible dishes allow food changes without reaching into the cage (reduces cage territoriality).

### Toys
- Provide a variety of toys (see toy-types-rotation.md).
- Do not overcrowd the cage -- the bird needs room to move.
- 3-5 toys at a time is appropriate for most cage sizes, rotated regularly.
- Include at least one foraging toy, one destructible toy, and one foot toy.

### Cage Floor
- **Grate bottom**: A grate above the cage tray keeps the bird from accessing droppings and discarded food.
- **Paper lining**: Plain newspaper, butcher paper, or cage liner paper. Allows easy monitoring of droppings (color, consistency, volume).
- **Avoid**: Wood shavings (dust, mold risk), corn cob bedding (mold growth), walnut shell (ingestion risk).

## Cage Maintenance

- **Daily**: Change water, remove uneaten fresh food, spot-clean soiled areas, replace cage floor paper.
- **Weekly**: Wash all food and water dishes thoroughly, wipe down perches, clean cage bars.
- **Monthly**: Deep clean the entire cage with bird-safe disinfectant (dilute vinegar or avian-specific cleaner). Rinse thoroughly and dry before returning the bird.
- **Ongoing**: Inspect for rust, chipped coating, damaged bars, or loose parts.
