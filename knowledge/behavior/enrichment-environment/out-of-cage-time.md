# Out-of-Cage Time

## Overview

Out-of-cage time is a non-negotiable requirement for the physical and psychological health of companion parrots. No matter how large or well-furnished a cage is, it cannot replace the enrichment, exercise, socialization, and freedom that out-of-cage time provides. Parrots are intelligent, active animals that need to explore, fly or climb, interact socially, and experience environmental variety. Daily supervised out-of-cage time is essential for preventing obesity, boredom, depression, feather plucking, and other behavioral and health problems.

## Recommended Duration

- **Minimum**: 2-4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time daily.
- **Ideal**: As much supervised time as possible. Many experienced parrot owners keep their birds out of the cage for most of the day, returning them only for meals and bedtime.
- **Quality matters**: Active, interactive time (training, play, social interaction) is more enriching than simply being out on a playstand in an empty room.

## Setting Up a Safe Out-of-Cage Area

### Bird-Proofing
- **Windows and mirrors**: Cover or use decals to prevent flight collisions.
- **Ceiling fans**: Always off when the bird is out.
- **Doors and windows**: Closed. Use caution when entering and exiting rooms.
- **Toxic plants**: Remove all plants from the flight area (many common houseplants are toxic to birds).
- **Open water**: Cover toilets, sinks, and any standing water.
- **Hot surfaces**: Block access to stoves, heaters, and candles.
- **Other pets**: Remove cats, dogs, and ferrets from the room.
- **Small objects**: Remove items small enough to be swallowed (beads, small toys, jewelry, pen caps).
- **Electrical cords**: Cover or block access to exposed wiring.
- **Chemical exposure**: Remove air fresheners, candles, nonstick cookware fumes, cleaning chemicals.

### Providing Stations
- **Playstands/T-stands**: Provide one or more designated play areas with perches, toys, and food/water.
- **Multiple locations**: Having playstands in different rooms allows the bird to accompany you throughout the house.
- **Activity centers**: Large play gyms with ladders, swings, and toy hooks provide extensive enrichment.
- **Perch variety**: Include different materials and diameters on play areas.

## Activities During Out-of-Cage Time

### Social Interaction
- Talk to and interact with the bird.
- Include the bird in household activities (meal preparation where safe, watching TV, reading, working at a desk).
- Shared meals (offer bird-safe fresh foods alongside your own meal).

### Training Sessions
- Use out-of-cage time for training sessions (step-up, target, tricks, recall).
- Training provides concentrated mental stimulation and strengthens the bond.
- See training documents for specific training guidance.

### Foraging
- Set up foraging activities on the playstand or play area.
- Scatter feeding on a foraging tray.
- Foraging toys that the bird can work on during out-of-cage time.

### Physical Exercise
- Encourage climbing on play gyms and ladders.
- Flight exercise for flighted birds (recall training, room-to-room flights).
- Active play with foot toys or interactive toys.

### Bathing
- Offer bathing opportunities during out-of-cage time (misting, shallow dish, shower perch).
- See bathing-water-play.md for details.

### Exploration
- Allow supervised exploration of bird-safe areas.
- Novel objects and environments provide mental stimulation (rearrange furniture occasionally, introduce new bird-safe items).

## Managing Out-of-Cage Challenges

### Bird Won't Come Out
- Some birds (particularly those that are cage-territorial or fearful) may be reluctant to leave the cage.
- Open the cage door and place a treat or favorite toy just outside the door.
- Use target training to guide the bird to the door and out.
- Be patient -- never pull or force the bird out.
- If the bird steps out briefly and retreats, that is progress. Reinforce any step outside.

### Bird Won't Go Back In
- Make returning to the cage positive: a special treat is waiting inside.
- Use a consistent cue ("go home," "cage time") paired with a treat in the cage.
- Train recall to your hand, then step the bird onto a cage-door perch.
- Never chase or grab the bird to return it -- this makes returning to the cage aversive.
- Schedule return time before the bird becomes overtired or cranky.

### Bird Chews Inappropriate Items
- This is natural -- parrots explore and chew everything.
- Redirect to appropriate chew toys or foraging items on the playstand.
- Remove or protect items you don't want chewed (furniture edges, books, remotes).
- Provide ample appropriate chewing material on the play area.

### Droppings
- Parrots cannot be fully "potty trained" in the way dogs can.
- Some birds can be trained to poop on command or in a specific location with consistent reinforcement.
- Place washable mats or towels under play areas.
- Most birds defecate every 15-30 minutes -- plan accordingly.

### Shoulder Sitting
- Controversial topic in avian behavior. Some behaviorists discourage it (bird at face level can cause eye injury; dominant position may increase territorial behavior).
- Others find it a positive bonding activity for birds that behave well on the shoulder.
- **Guidelines if allowing shoulder time**: Only with well-trained birds that step down from the shoulder reliably on cue. Not recommended during hormonal periods. Not recommended with species known for unpredictable aggression (Amazon parrots, cockatoos). Never with large macaws near the face.
