# Separation Anxiety

## Overview

Separation anxiety in companion parrots is a behavioral condition characterized by excessive distress when the bird is separated from its primary bonded person or flock group. Given that parrots are social flock animals that have evolved to maintain constant contact with their flock, some degree of protest when separated is natural. However, when the distress becomes extreme, prolonged, or leads to self-harm, it crosses into pathological separation anxiety. This condition is particularly common in species that form intensely close bonds, such as cockatoos, and can significantly impact both the bird's welfare and the owner's quality of life.

## Normal Separation Behavior vs. Separation Anxiety

### Normal Behavior
- **Contact calling** when the owner leaves the room -- a brief call to check location, satisfied by a verbal response.
- Mild vocalization that subsides within minutes.
- The bird occupies itself with toys, foraging, or preening after the owner leaves.
- Eagerness upon the owner's return but no signs of distress during absence.

### Separation Anxiety
- **Continuous, intense screaming** that does not subside after the owner leaves. May continue for hours.
- **Feather plucking or self-mutilation** during the owner's absence.
- **Refusal to eat** when the bonded person is away.
- **Destructive behavior**: Excessive cage bar chewing, destroying toys frantically rather than playing.
- **Extreme agitation upon departure**: Pacing, wing flapping, lunging at the cage bars as the owner prepares to leave.
- **Excessive clinging** upon return: Refusing to be put down, frantic contact-seeking.
- **Redirected aggression**: Biting other family members or attacking other birds when the bonded person is absent.

## Species Most Prone

- **Cockatoos**: The most commonly affected species. Their intense bonding nature makes them extremely susceptible. Moluccan and Umbrella Cockatoos are particularly vulnerable.
- **African Grey Parrots**: Sensitive and prone to anxiety when their routine or social environment changes.
- **Macaws**: Intense pair bonding can lead to separation distress.
- **Eclectus Parrots**: Some individuals develop strong attachment and anxiety.
- **Lovebirds**: Named for their pair bonding -- separation from a bonded partner (human or avian) can cause significant distress.

## Contributing Factors

- **Overly exclusive bonding**: When the bird has bonded to only one person and has no other social relationships.
- **Constant contact**: A bird that has been with its owner 24/7 (work from home, retirement) and then experiences sudden alone time (return to office, schedule change).
- **Early developmental factors**: Birds weaned too early, hand-raised without adequate flock socialization, or raised in isolation.
- **Reinforcement of clingy behavior**: Consistently returning to a screaming bird (teaching it that screaming brings the person back).
- **Lack of independence skills**: A bird that has never learned to entertain itself (forage, play with toys, preen independently).
- **Previous loss**: Birds that have experienced the loss of a bonded companion may be more anxious about separation.

## Management and Treatment

### Building Independence
- **Teach the bird to play independently**: Provide engaging foraging toys and activities that the bird can do alone.
- **Gradual departure training**:
  1. Leave the room for 5 seconds and return before the bird screams.
  2. Gradually increase the duration of absence, always returning while the bird is still calm.
  3. Reward calm behavior with treats and praise upon return.
  4. Very gradually extend absence duration over days and weeks.
- **Departure cue**: Develop a consistent, calm departure phrase ("I'll be back") that the bird learns to associate with your inevitable return.
- **Pre-departure enrichment**: Set up foraging activities and fresh toys before leaving so the bird has immediate occupation.

### Reducing Exclusive Bonding
- Have multiple family members participate in feeding, training, and positive interaction.
- Encourage the bird to accept handling and affection from more than one person.
- Avoid having only one person do all the caregiving.

### Environmental Support
- **Foraging enrichment**: Fill the cage with foraging toys that occupy the bird during alone time.
- **Background stimulation**: Leave a radio or TV on (at low volume) to provide ambient social sounds.
- **Window view**: If safe, position the cage where the bird can watch outdoor activity.
- **Routine**: Maintain a highly predictable schedule so the bird knows when the owner will return.

### What NOT to Do
- **Do not return to the bird when it is screaming** (unless there is a genuine safety concern). Returning reinforces screaming as an effective recall strategy.
- **Do not punish** the bird for separation distress. Punishment increases anxiety.
- **Do not make departures dramatic**: Avoid long, emotional goodbyes. Be calm and matter-of-fact.
- **Do not make arrivals overly exciting**: A brief, calm greeting prevents the arrival from becoming the only positive event of the day.

### Veterinary and Behavioral Support
- **Anti-anxiety medication**: In severe cases, an avian veterinarian may prescribe anxiolytic medication (fluoxetine, clomipramine) as part of a comprehensive treatment plan.
- **Behavioral consultation**: A certified avian behaviorist can develop a customized desensitization and management plan.
- **Consider an avian companion**: In some cases, a compatible second bird can provide companionship during the owner's absence. However, this is not guaranteed to help and introduces its own complexities (see multi-bird-household.md).

## Prevention

- From the beginning, encourage the bird to interact with multiple people.
- Establish alone time early in the relationship -- do not create a pattern of constant togetherness.
- Teach independent play skills from a young age.
- Avoid creating an expectation of 24/7 companionship, even if you are currently home all day.
- Ensure the bird has engaging enrichment that it can enjoy independently.
