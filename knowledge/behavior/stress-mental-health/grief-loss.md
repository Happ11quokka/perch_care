# Grief & Loss in Companion Parrots

## Overview

Parrots, as highly social and emotionally complex animals, are capable of experiencing grief and mourning following the loss of a bonded companion -- whether that companion is another bird, a human family member, or even another household pet with which the bird had a relationship. The depth of grief parrots can experience is often underestimated. Birds can exhibit behavioral and physical changes that parallel mourning behaviors observed in other intelligent social animals. Understanding and supporting a grieving parrot is essential for preventing the grief from progressing into chronic depression, feather destructive behavior, or illness.

## Evidence of Grief in Parrots

While the subjective experience of grief in animals is debated scientifically, the behavioral evidence in parrots is compelling:
- Wild parrots have been observed returning repeatedly to the site where a mate died.
- Captive parrots show dramatic behavioral changes when a bonded companion dies or is rehomed.
- Physiological stress markers (elevated corticosterone) have been documented in bereaved birds.
- The behavioral changes seen in grieving parrots parallel those seen in grieving mammals.

## Signs of Grief

### Behavioral Changes
- **Loss of appetite**: Reduced food intake or complete refusal to eat. This can become dangerous if prolonged (birds have high metabolic rates).
- **Silence**: A normally vocal bird becoming quiet -- no singing, talking, or contact calling.
- **Calling for the lost companion**: Repeated contact calls directed at areas where the companion used to be.
- **Searching behavior**: Moving restlessly through the cage or around the home as if looking for someone.
- **Lethargy**: Decreased activity, sitting fluffed on a perch, reduced interest in play or interaction.
- **Feather destructive behavior**: Onset or worsening of feather plucking following a loss.
- **Changes in sleep**: Sleeping more than usual or restlessness during sleep.
- **Decreased grooming**: Neglect of normal preening behavior.
- **Clinginess or withdrawal**: Some birds become excessively clingy with remaining companions; others withdraw from social interaction entirely.
- **Aggression**: Some birds become irritable and aggressive during grief.

### Physical Changes
- **Weight loss**: From reduced food intake and stress-related metabolic changes.
- **Weakened immune system**: Grief-related stress suppresses immune function, making the bird more vulnerable to illness.
- **Droppings changes**: Stress-related changes in fecal volume, consistency, or color.
- **Feather condition**: Deterioration in feather quality from reduced preening and nutritional intake.

## Situations That Cause Grief

- **Death of a bonded avian companion**: Particularly if the birds were a long-term pair.
- **Death of the primary human caretaker**: The bird may have been bonded to this person for years or decades.
- **Rehoming a companion bird**: Removing a cage mate or bonded partner.
- **Separation from the bonded human**: Divorce, hospitalization, moving, or death.
- **Death of another household pet**: If the bird had a positive relationship with a dog, cat, or other pet.
- **Children leaving home**: If the bird was bonded to a child who moves away.

## Supporting a Grieving Bird

### Immediate Actions
- **Monitor food and water intake closely**: Weigh the bird daily. If the bird is not eating for more than 24-48 hours, consult an avian veterinarian. Assist feeding may be necessary.
- **Maintain routine**: Keep the daily schedule as normal as possible. Routine provides security and predictability.
- **Increase social interaction**: Spend extra time with the bird. Talk to it, sit nearby, offer favorite treats.
- **Familiar environment**: Do not rearrange the cage or move it during the acute grief period -- additional changes add stress.

### Ongoing Support
- **Patience**: Grief is a process that takes time. Some birds recover in days; others may take weeks or months.
- **Enrichment**: Gently encourage engagement with foraging toys, new toys, and activities.
- **Bathing**: Offer bathing opportunities, which can be soothing and encourage preening.
- **Music**: Soft, familiar music may provide comfort.
- **Allow expression**: Do not try to suppress grief behaviors (calling, searching). These are part of the processing.

### Regarding the Lost Bird's Belongings
- If a companion bird has died, there are varying opinions on what to do with the deceased bird's cage, toys, and perches.
- Some experts suggest leaving familiar items initially for comfort.
- Others suggest gradual removal to prevent the bird from searching for its companion.
- Observe the individual bird's response and adjust accordingly.

### When to Seek Veterinary Help
- If the bird refuses food for more than 24-48 hours.
- If the bird loses significant weight (more than 5-10% of body weight).
- If feather destructive behavior or self-mutilation begins.
- If the bird shows signs of illness (fluffed feathers, lethargy, abnormal droppings, respiratory changes).
- Grief can suppress immune function, making the bird vulnerable to opportunistic infections.

## Considering a New Companion

- Do not rush to replace a lost companion. The grieving bird needs time to process.
- A new bird is not guaranteed to help and may cause additional stress (territory disputes, incompatibility).
- If considering a new bird, wait until the grieving bird has stabilized emotionally and physically (usually weeks to months).
- Follow proper introduction protocols (see multi-bird-household.md) including quarantine.
- Some birds may never accept a new companion, particularly older birds that were bonded to one partner for many years.

## Owner Grief

- The loss of a companion parrot is also deeply felt by owners. Given that many parrots live for decades, the human-bird bond can be one of the longest interspecies relationships.
- Pet loss support resources are available and appropriate for grieving bird owners.
- Other household birds may sense and respond to the owner's grief, making owner self-care important for the remaining birds' well-being.
