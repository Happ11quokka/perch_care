# Stress Indicators in Companion Parrots

## Overview

Stress is a physiological and psychological response to perceived threats, environmental challenges, or unmet needs. While short-term (acute) stress is a normal adaptive response that helps birds respond to danger, chronic stress -- ongoing, unrelieved stress -- is profoundly damaging to companion parrots' physical and mental health. Recognizing the signs of stress early is critical for intervention, as chronic stress leads to immune suppression, behavioral disorders, feather destructive behavior, and shortened lifespan. Parrots communicate stress through body language, behavioral changes, and physical symptoms that owners must learn to identify.

## Types of Stress

### Acute Stress
- Short-term response to an immediate threat or challenge.
- Examples: Veterinary visit, loud noise, predator sighting, being restrained.
- Normal and adaptive -- the bird's body mobilizes resources to deal with the situation.
- Resolves when the threat is removed.
- Becomes problematic only if the stressor is repeated frequently without recovery time.

### Chronic Stress
- Long-term, persistent stress from ongoing environmental or social conditions.
- Examples: Social isolation, inadequate sleep, constant noise, incompatible cage mate, understimulation.
- The bird's stress response system (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) remains activated.
- Causes progressive damage to health and behavior.
- Requires identification and resolution of the underlying stressor.

## Behavioral Stress Indicators

### Body Language
- **Feather slicking**: Holding feathers tight against the body, making the bird appear thin and sleek. Indicates fear or anxiety.
- **Wide eyes with visible eye ring**: A stressed bird may show more of the white eye ring (in species where this is visible).
- **Eye pinning**: Rapid, repeated dilation and constriction of the pupils, combined with tense body posture, indicates agitation.
- **Crouching**: A bird that crouches low on the perch with slicked feathers may be frightened.
- **Freezing**: Complete immobility -- a fear response that is often mistaken for calmness.
- **Panting/open-mouth breathing**: Can indicate overheating but also extreme stress or fear.
- **Trembling**: Visible body tremors from fear or anxiety.

### Behavioral Changes
- **Increased aggression**: Biting, lunging, or attacking that is new or escalating.
- **Excessive screaming**: Increased volume, frequency, or duration of vocalizations.
- **Silence**: A normally vocal bird that becomes consistently quiet may be stressed or ill.
- **Feather destructive behavior**: Plucking, chewing, or barbering feathers (see feather-plucking.md).
- **Self-mutilation**: Chewing or picking at skin (see self-mutilation.md).
- **Stereotypic behavior**: Repetitive, purposeless movements -- pacing, head-bobbing, bar-chewing (see stereotypic-behavior.md).
- **Decreased activity**: Lethargy, sitting fluffed on a perch, reduced interest in play and interaction.
- **Appetite changes**: Loss of appetite or, conversely, compulsive eating.
- **Sleep disturbances**: Difficulty settling, frequent waking, excessive sleeping during the day.
- **Regression in training**: A well-trained bird that stops responding to cues may be stressed.
- **Cage clinging**: Gripping the cage bars tightly and refusing to release.
- **Avoidance**: Retreating to the back of the cage, hiding behind toys or perches.

### Stress-Related Vocalizations
- **Alarm calls**: Loud, sharp, repetitive calls.
- **Growling**: A low, throaty sound indicating discomfort or warning.
- **Hissing**: Some species hiss when stressed or threatened.
- **Whimpering**: Soft, repeated sounds indicating distress.

## Physical Stress Indicators

- **Stress bars**: Horizontal lines visible across the vanes of growing feathers. These bars form during periods of stress when feather development is temporarily disrupted. Stress bars indicate that the bird experienced stress during the period of feather growth.
- **Feather quality deterioration**: Dull, dry, or brittle feathers.
- **Weight loss**: Chronic stress can suppress appetite or increase metabolic demand.
- **Weakened immune system**: Increased frequency of infections (respiratory, gastrointestinal).
- **Droppings changes**: Stress can cause loose, watery droppings (polyuria) or other changes.
- **Elevated corticosterone**: Blood testing can reveal chronically elevated stress hormones (requires veterinary testing).

## Common Stressors in Captivity

### Environmental
- Inadequate cage size or poor cage placement.
- Lack of enrichment (toys, foraging, variety).
- Exposure to toxins (fumes, aerosols, smoke).
- Temperature extremes or drafts.
- Excessive or unpredictable noise.
- Sudden environmental changes (moving, redecorating).
- Inappropriate lighting (too much or too little; no natural light cycle).

### Social
- Social isolation or insufficient interaction.
- Loss of a companion (human or avian).
- Conflict with other birds or household pets.
- New household members (people or animals).
- Inconsistent handling by different people.
- Excessive handling or forced interaction.

### Physical
- Illness or pain.
- Sleep deprivation (less than 10-12 hours).
- Nutritional deficiency.
- Hormonal imbalance.
- Wing clipping or physical restraint.

### Routine
- Lack of predictable daily routine.
- Frequent disruptions to schedule.
- Unpredictable meal times.
- Travel or boarding.

## Responding to Stress

1. **Identify the stressor**: Observe what has changed in the bird's environment, routine, social situation, or health.
2. **Remove or modify the stressor**: If possible, eliminate the stress source. If not possible, modify the bird's exposure.
3. **Provide security**: Ensure the bird has a safe retreat, predictable routine, and stable social interaction.
4. **Veterinary evaluation**: If stress signs persist or physical symptoms are present, consult an avian veterinarian to rule out medical causes.
5. **Enrichment**: Increase foraging opportunities, social interaction, and environmental variety.
6. **Patience**: Recovery from chronic stress takes time. Behavioral improvement may take weeks to months.
