# Environmental Stressors

## Overview

Environmental stressors are physical conditions in a companion parrot's living space that cause stress, discomfort, or harm. Unlike social stressors (which involve relationships) or psychological stressors (which involve mental state), environmental stressors are external, physical factors that the bird is exposed to in its immediate environment. Many environmental stressors are easily identified and corrected once recognized, making environmental assessment one of the most impactful first steps in addressing a stressed bird's welfare. Parrots are particularly sensitive to environmental quality because of their highly efficient respiratory systems, acute hearing, and sensitivity to toxins.

## Air Quality

### Airborne Toxins
- **Nonstick cookware fumes (PTFE/Teflon)**: When overheated, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-coated cookware releases fumes that are rapidly fatal to birds. Even normal cooking temperatures can release harmful particles. This is the most common cause of acute toxic death in companion birds.
- **Aerosol sprays**: Air fresheners, hairspray, perfume, deodorant sprays, cleaning sprays.
- **Scented candles and incense**: Release volatile compounds and particulate matter.
- **Cigarette/cigar/vape smoke**: Causes respiratory damage, feather deterioration, and increased disease risk. Secondhand and thirdhand smoke are dangerous.
- **Self-cleaning oven fumes**: The high-temperature cleaning cycle releases toxic fumes.
- **New carpet/furniture off-gassing**: Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from new materials.
- **Paint fumes**: Fresh paint and solvents release VOCs.
- **Cleaning chemicals**: Bleach, ammonia, and chemical cleaners in enclosed spaces.

### Dust and Particulates
- **Construction dust**: Home renovations create dangerous particulate exposure.
- **Excessive feather dust**: Powder-down species (cockatoos, African Greys, cockatiels) produce significant dust. In homes with multiple powder-down birds, air quality can deteriorate.
- **Management**: Use HEPA air purifiers near bird areas. Maintain good ventilation. Regular cleaning of surfaces.

### Humidity
- **Low humidity** (common in heated homes during winter): Causes dry skin, itchy feathers, and respiratory irritation. Ideal humidity: 40-60%.
- **Mitigation**: Use a humidifier in the bird's room, offer regular bathing opportunities.

## Temperature

- **Safe range**: 18-27°C (65-80°F) for most companion parrot species.
- **Drafts**: Cold air drafts from windows, doors, or air conditioning vents cause localized chilling. Birds are particularly susceptible to drafts.
- **Rapid temperature changes**: Moving from a warm room to a cold one (or vice versa) is stressful.
- **Overheating**: Direct sun exposure without shade, placement near heaters or radiators, poor ventilation in hot weather. Birds do not sweat and rely on panting and holding wings away from the body to cool down.
- **Hypothermia risk**: Temperatures below 15°C (60°F) are dangerous for most tropical species.

## Light

### Insufficient Natural Light
- Parrots need exposure to appropriate light cycles to maintain circadian rhythm and hormonal balance.
- Rooms without windows or natural light disrupt the bird's internal clock.
- **Solution**: Position the cage where natural light is available (but with shade access). Use avian-specific full-spectrum lighting if natural light is insufficient.

### Excessive Artificial Light
- More than 12-14 hours of artificial light per day triggers chronic hormonal stimulation.
- Household lights, TV screens, and other electronic screens extend the perceived "day."
- **Solution**: Ensure 10-12 hours of complete darkness for sleep. Use cage covers or a dedicated sleep room.

### Inappropriate Spectrum
- Standard indoor lighting lacks the UVB component found in natural sunlight.
- UVB is necessary for vitamin D3 synthesis and affects how birds see their environment (birds can see into the UV spectrum; under standard lighting, their world appears dull).

## Noise

### Chronic Loud Noise
- Constant household noise (loud TV, music, shouting, barking dogs) creates chronic stress.
- Parrots naturally vocalize to compete with ambient noise -- a loud household creates a louder bird in a self-escalating cycle.
- **Solution**: Reduce ambient noise levels. Place the cage away from the loudest areas of the home.

### Sudden Loud Noises
- Fireworks, thunder, smoke alarms, construction noise, and door slamming can trigger panic and night frights.
- **Solution**: Provide a calm environment. Use white noise to buffer sudden sounds during the night.

### Ultrasonic Devices
- Some pest deterrent devices and electronics emit ultrasonic sounds that are inaudible to humans but may be perceived by birds, causing unexplained stress.

## Cage-Related Stressors

### Inappropriate Cage Size
- A cage that is too small restricts movement, prevents wing stretching, and causes frustration.
- See cage-setup-design.md for size guidelines.

### Poor Cage Placement
- High-traffic areas where people constantly walk past can cause hypervigilance.
- Isolated rooms cause social deprivation.
- Near kitchens (toxic fumes), bathrooms (humidity/chemicals), or external doors (drafts, escape risk).

### Cage Floor Directly on Ground
- Ground-level cages make the bird feel vulnerable to ground predators.
- Elevate the cage to at least waist height for a sense of security.

### Overcrowding
- Too many toys, perches, or birds in the cage restricts movement and can increase territorial conflict.

## Chemical Exposure

### Household Chemicals
- Cleaning products used near the bird's cage.
- Laundry detergent fumes (especially fragrance-heavy products).
- Floor cleaning chemicals (the bird may walk on treated surfaces during out-of-cage time).
- **Solution**: Use bird-safe cleaning products (dilute white vinegar, avian-specific cleaners). Clean the bird's area when the bird is in a different, well-ventilated room.

### Heavy Metals
- Zinc: Found in galvanized wire, zippers, snaps, and some toys.
- Lead: Found in old paint, some curtain weights, some stained glass, and fishing weights.
- Copper: Found in pennies (post-1982 pennies have a zinc core).
- **Solution**: Ensure all cage components are stainless steel. Remove access to metal objects.

## Vibration
- Washing machines, dryers, HVAC systems, and heavy foot traffic create vibrations that can disturb birds, particularly at night.
- **Solution**: Place the cage on a stable surface away from vibration sources.

## Assessment Checklist

When evaluating environmental stressors, systematically check:
- [ ] Air quality (fumes, smoke, aerosols, dust)
- [ ] Temperature and drafts
- [ ] Humidity level
- [ ] Light cycle (hours of light/dark)
- [ ] Noise level and sources
- [ ] Cage size and placement
- [ ] Chemical exposure
- [ ] Heavy metal exposure
- [ ] Vibration sources
- [ ] Other pets in the environment
