# Rehoming & Adjustment

## Overview

Rehoming -- the process of a companion parrot being transferred from one owner or living situation to another -- is one of the most stressful experiences a parrot can undergo. Given that parrots form deep, long-lasting bonds and are creatures of routine, the loss of their familiar environment, bonded people, and established social structure can cause profound psychological distress. Rehomed parrots face an adjustment period that may last weeks to months, during which they may exhibit a range of stress behaviors including fear, aggression, withdrawal, feather plucking, and food refusal. Understanding the rehoming adjustment process is essential for new owners to provide the patience and support these birds need.

## Why Parrots Are Rehomed

- **Owner lifestyle changes**: Moving, divorce, new baby, job changes, financial hardship.
- **Behavioral problems**: Biting, screaming, and feather plucking that the owner cannot manage.
- **Owner illness or death**: The parrot outlives its owner (many parrot species live 30-80 years).
- **Allergies**: Development of allergies to feather dust or dander.
- **Unrealistic expectations**: The owner was unprepared for the demands of parrot ownership.
- **Multi-pet conflicts**: Incompatibility with other household pets.

## The Adjustment Process

### Phase 1: Honeymoon Period (First 1-2 Weeks)
- Some rehomed birds appear calm, quiet, and cooperative during the first few days.
- This is often a **stress response** (shutdown behavior), not genuine comfort.
- The bird is observing and assessing its new environment.
- Do not mistake this quiet phase for adjustment -- behavioral challenges often emerge after this period.

### Phase 2: Testing Period (Weeks 2-8)
- The bird begins expressing its true personality and testing boundaries.
- Behavioral issues may surface: biting, screaming, food refusal, feather plucking.
- This is normal and expected. The bird is processing the loss of its previous environment and relationships.
- Consistent, patient, positive interaction is critical during this phase.

### Phase 3: Settling In (Months 2-6)
- Gradual establishment of routine and trust.
- Behavioral challenges may persist but typically begin to improve with consistent management.
- The bird starts accepting the new environment and people as its "flock."
- Bond formation with the new owner begins.

### Phase 4: Integration (6 Months to 1+ Year)
- The bird is settled into its new life.
- Established routines and relationships.
- Some birds adjust faster; others, particularly those with traumatic histories, may take a year or more.
- Behavioral issues may persist as lifelong management challenges.

## Common Adjustment Challenges

### Fear and Mistrust
- The bird may be terrified of its new environment, unfamiliar people, and different routines.
- **Management**: Follow the new bird socialization protocol (see socializing-new-bird.md). Do not force interaction. Allow the bird to approach on its own terms.

### Aggression
- Biting and lunging may occur as the bird tries to establish boundaries or responds to fear.
- May be directed at all family members or specifically at people who resemble someone from the bird's past.
- **Management**: Identify triggers, use positive reinforcement training, work at the bird's pace.

### Feather Destructive Behavior
- Rehoming is a common trigger for feather plucking.
- Stress, anxiety, and loss of social bonds contribute.
- **Management**: Address environmental and social needs first. See feather-plucking.md. Consult an avian veterinarian if plucking is severe.

### Food Refusal
- The bird may refuse unfamiliar food brands, presentation styles, or food items.
- **Management**: Ask the previous owner what the bird was eating and provide the same foods initially. Gradually introduce desired dietary changes. See food-refusal.md.

### Excessive Screaming
- Contact calling for previous owners or expressing distress.
- **Management**: Respond to contact calls briefly. Provide enrichment. Establish routine. See excessive-screaming.md.

### Withdrawal and Depression
- Some birds become very quiet, inactive, and withdraw from interaction.
- This can be more concerning than aggressive behavior because it may indicate deep depression.
- **Management**: Spend time near the bird without demanding interaction. Offer favorite treats. Provide enrichment. Consult an avian veterinarian if the bird stops eating or shows signs of illness.

## Best Practices for New Owners of Rehomed Birds

### Before the Bird Arrives
- Gather as much history as possible from the previous owner: diet, favorite foods, preferred toys, sleeping schedule, known fears, medical history, behavioral patterns.
- Set up the cage in a social but calm area of the home.
- Have appropriate food, water, perches, and a few toys ready.
- Schedule a veterinary exam within the first 1-2 weeks.

### First Days
- Follow the new bird protocol: quiet, gentle, minimal handling, let the bird observe and adjust.
- Maintain the bird's previous routine as much as possible (meal times, sleep times).
- Use the same food the bird was eating previously.
- Speak softly and spend time near the cage without demanding interaction.

### Building Trust
- Let the bird set the pace for interaction.
- Use positive reinforcement: treats, soft verbal praise, and patience.
- Begin training (target training, step-up) when the bird shows willingness.
- Do not take rejection personally. Trust takes time.
- Celebrate small victories: the bird eating in your presence, approaching the cage door, taking a treat from your hand.

### Understanding the Bird's History
- A bird's previous experiences profoundly shape its behavior.
- Abuse, neglect, or multiple rehomings may create deep-seated fear and mistrust.
- Behavioral "problems" are often coping mechanisms the bird developed in response to its history.
- Be compassionate and patient. You are rebuilding trust that may have been broken multiple times.

## When to Seek Professional Help

- If the bird is not eating and losing weight.
- If feather plucking or self-mutilation is severe.
- If aggression is causing injury.
- If the bird shows signs of illness (rehoming stress can trigger latent infections).
- If adjustment does not progress after several months of consistent effort.
- Consult an avian veterinarian for medical concerns and a certified avian behaviorist for behavioral challenges.
