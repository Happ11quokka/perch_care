# Night Frights

## Overview

Night frights (also called "night thrashing" or "night panic") are sudden, violent episodes of panic that occur when a bird is startled during sleep in darkness. The bird thrashes wildly inside the cage, crashing into bars, perches, toys, and dishes, often resulting in injury. Night frights are most common in cockatiels and budgerigars but can occur in any species. While a single episode may be harmless, recurrent night frights pose a significant injury risk and indicate that the bird's sleep environment needs modification.

## Species Most Affected

- **Cockatiels**: The most commonly affected species. Night frights are so prevalent in cockatiels that they are considered a breed-characteristic behavior.
- **Budgerigars (Parakeets)**: Highly susceptible, particularly in multi-bird environments where one bird's panic triggers group panic.
- **Finches and Canaries**: Small passerines are also prone.
- **Other parrots**: Any species can experience night frights, though less commonly than cockatiels and budgerigars.

## What Happens During a Night Fright

1. The bird is asleep in darkness.
2. A trigger stimulus (real or perceived) startles the bird awake.
3. In the darkness, the disoriented bird cannot see its surroundings and panics.
4. The bird thrashes violently, flapping wings and crashing into cage bars, perches, toys, and dishes.
5. The episode may last seconds to minutes.
6. Other birds in the same cage or room may be triggered into panic by the commotion.

## Common Triggers

- **Shadows and light changes**: Car headlights moving across walls, streetlights, TV light from another room, moonlight through curtains.
- **Sounds**: Thunder, fireworks, household noises (HVAC systems turning on, appliance sounds, doors closing), other pets (cats walking near the cage at night).
- **Vibrations**: Footsteps, heavy vehicles outside, washing machines, earthquakes.
- **Predator presence**: Cats or dogs approaching the cage at night. Even the sound or scent may trigger panic.
- **Insects**: Moths, flies, or other insects fluttering near or inside the cage.
- **Earthquake-like events**: Seismic activity or heavy trucks causing vibrations.
- **Unknown triggers**: Some night frights have no identifiable external trigger and may relate to dreams or internal startling.

## Potential Injuries

- **Broken blood feathers**: The most common injury. Thrashing causes growing feathers to break and bleed.
- **Wing and toe injuries**: Catching wings or toes in cage bars.
- **Bruising**: Impact with cage bars and perches.
- **Head trauma**: Crashing into cage bars or the top of the cage.
- **Lacerations**: Cuts from sharp cage edges, broken toys, or food dish clips.
- **Broken feathers**: Wing and tail feathers can be snapped off.
- **Stress**: Repeated episodes cause chronic stress, even if no physical injury occurs.

## Immediate Response

When you hear a night fright in progress:
1. **Turn on a light** (a dim light first, then gradually brighter) so the bird can see and orient itself.
2. **Speak calmly and softly** to the bird. Your familiar voice will help it calm down.
3. **Do NOT reach into the cage immediately**. The bird is still panicked and may bite defensively. Wait until the bird settles.
4. **Check for injuries**: Once calm, examine the bird for broken blood feathers, bleeding, limping, or wing droop.
5. **First aid for bleeding**: Apply styptic powder or cornstarch to any bleeding blood feathers. If bleeding is heavy, the feather may need to be pulled (see molting-behavior.md for blood feather emergency protocol).
6. **Keep the light on** for the rest of the night if the bird seems anxious.

## Prevention Strategies

### Night Light
- Provide a **dim nightlight** in the room where the bird sleeps. This is the single most effective prevention measure.
- The light should be dim enough not to disrupt sleep (a low-wattage LED nightlight or a nightlight with a warm-colored bulb).
- The nightlight allows the bird to see its surroundings if it wakes, preventing disoriented panic.
- Position the nightlight so it provides ambient illumination without shining directly on the cage.

### Cage Placement
- Place the cage **away from windows** where car headlights, streetlights, or animal activity could trigger panic.
- Avoid placing the cage near exterior walls where outside sounds are louder.
- Keep the cage away from heating/cooling vents that cycle on and off at night.
- If cats or dogs are in the household, ensure they cannot access the room where the bird sleeps at night.

### Cage Setup
- **Remove unnecessary toys** at night, particularly hanging toys that swing and make noise when the bird thrashes.
- **Use padded perch covers** or natural rope perches that are less likely to cause injury.
- **Ensure food and water dishes are securely attached** and will not become projectiles during thrashing.
- **Use a cage with appropriate bar spacing** -- bars too wide apart can trap wings and toes.

### Environmental Management
- Minimize nighttime noise disturbances (close windows, use white noise machines to mask sudden sounds).
- Maintain a consistent, calm nighttime environment.
- If multiple birds are in the same room, consider separating a bird prone to night frights so it does not trigger panic in others.

### Cage Cover
- A cage cover can help block visual disturbances (headlights, shadows) but should be breathable.
- Some birds feel more secure with a partial cover (covering three sides, leaving the front open toward the nightlight).
- In some cases, covers can worsen night frights if the bird becomes panicked and trapped under the cover. Know your individual bird's response.

### Sleep Cage
- A separate, smaller sleep cage in a dark, quiet room can significantly reduce night fright triggers.
- The sleep cage should have minimal furniture (one perch, water dish) to reduce collision hazards.

## When to Seek Veterinary Attention

- If the bird is injured after a night fright (bleeding that does not stop, wing droop, limping, head tilt).
- If night frights are occurring frequently despite preventive measures (may indicate an underlying medical issue such as seizures, which can mimic night frights).
- If the bird exhibits neurological signs during or after episodes (incoordination, head tilt, circling).
- Neurological conditions, heavy metal toxicosis, or seizure disorders should be ruled out if episodes are frequent or unusual.
