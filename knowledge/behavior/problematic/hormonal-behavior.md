# Hormonal Behavior

## Overview

Hormonal behavior in companion parrots is driven by seasonal reproductive hormones and is a natural part of avian biology. In the wild, breeding season is triggered by environmental cues -- primarily increasing daylight hours, food abundance, warm temperatures, and availability of nesting sites. In captivity, many of these cues are inadvertently present year-round (extended artificial light, abundant food, warm homes, enclosed sleeping huts), leading to chronic or exaggerated hormonal behavior that causes significant problems for both the bird and its owner. Understanding hormonal triggers and management is essential for maintaining a healthy, well-adjusted companion parrot.

## Normal Breeding Season

- In the wild, most parrot species have a defined breeding season, typically in spring and early summer.
- Hormonal behavior during this period is normal and time-limited.
- In captivity, without proper environmental management, hormonal behavior can persist year-round.

## Signs of Hormonal Behavior

### General Signs (Both Sexes)
- **Increased aggression**: Particularly territorial aggression around the cage.
- **Eye pinning**: Rapid dilation and constriction of the pupils, often with an agitated demeanor.
- **Possessiveness**: Guarding a person, cage, or specific area.
- **Biting**: Increased frequency and intensity of biting.
- **Feather display**: Wing spreading, tail fanning, feather fluffing to appear larger.
- **Mood swings**: Unpredictable shifts between affectionate and aggressive.

### Female-Specific Signs
- **Egg laying**: Producing eggs (fertile or infertile).
- **Nesting behavior**: Shredding paper, seeking dark enclosed spaces, burrowing under furniture.
- **Broody posture**: Sitting low with fluffed feathers, guarding a specific area.
- **Regurgitation**: On objects, toys, or humans (courtship feeding behavior).
- **Vent presentation**: Lifting the tail and lowering the body when stroked.

### Male-Specific Signs
- **Regurgitation**: Head-bobbing and regurgitating food onto a bonded person, toy, or mirror.
- **Masturbation**: Rubbing the vent against perches, toys, hands, or other surfaces.
- **Strutting/displaying**: Exaggerated walking, wing spreading, tail fanning.
- **Increased vocalization**: Louder, more persistent calling (mate-attraction calls).
- **Eye pinning with pupil flashing**: Rapid pupil dilation, especially in Amazon parrots.

## Species-Specific Hormonal Patterns

- **Amazon Parrots**: Notoriously dangerous during hormonal periods. Males can become extremely aggressive ("hot" Amazons) with little warning. Severe bites are common. Owners should exercise extreme caution during breeding season.
- **Cockatoos**: Intense hormonal behavior with severe territorial aggression. Females are prone to chronic egg-laying.
- **Macaws**: Increased aggression and possessiveness. Strong pair bonding behavior toward one person.
- **African Greys**: Increased irritability, feather plucking may worsen during hormonal periods.
- **Cockatiels**: Females are extremely prone to chronic egg-laying, which can become life-threatening.
- **Budgerigars**: Prone to chronic egg-laying in females.
- **Lovebirds**: Strong nesting instincts, paper shredding, territorial aggression.

## Hormonal Triggers in Captivity

### Light Exposure
- **Trigger**: More than 12 hours of light per day signals "breeding season" to the bird's endocrine system.
- **Sources**: Artificial household lighting extending the perceived day length, TV/computer screens near the cage.

### Nesting Stimuli
- **Enclosed spaces**: Happy huts, snuggle tents, boxes, covered areas, cabinet shelves, under furniture. Any dark, enclosed space mimics a nesting cavity.
- **Nesting material**: Paper shredding access, fabric, bedding material.

### Inappropriate Touch
- **Back, wings, tail, and vent stroking**: Petting anywhere other than the head and neck stimulates reproductive behavior. This is one of the most common inadvertent hormonal triggers.

### Diet
- **High-fat, high-calorie foods**: Rich foods signal abundance and food security, triggering breeding condition.
- **Warm, soft foods**: Mimic regurgitated crop food associated with courtship.

### Social/Bonding Cues
- **Excessive cuddling**: Prolonged body contact mimics mate behavior.
- **Mirrors**: Some birds treat mirror reflections as a mate.
- **Single-person bonding**: Intense exclusive bonding with one person mimics pair bonding.

## Management Strategies

### Light Management
- Maintain a strict **10-12 hours of light and 12-14 hours of darkness** daily.
- Use a timer for cage covers or sleep cage room lights.
- Ensure true darkness (no ambient light from TVs, hallways, or windows).

### Remove Nesting Stimuli
- **Remove all enclosed spaces**: Happy huts, tents, boxes, and any structure the bird can enter.
- **Block access to dark areas**: Under furniture, in cabinets, behind cushions.
- **Limit paper/shredding material** during hormonal periods.
- Remove any eggs immediately (unless the bird is a chronic layer -- see veterinary guidance on egg management).

### Appropriate Touch
- **Pet only on the head and neck.** This mimics allopreening (flock behavior) and does not stimulate reproductive behavior.
- **Avoid** petting the back, wings, tail, belly, and under-wing areas.

### Dietary Management
- Reduce high-fat foods during hormonal periods (fewer nuts, seeds).
- Avoid warm, soft foods that mimic regurgitated food.
- Maintain a pellet-based diet with vegetables.

### Environmental Management
- **Rearrange the cage periodically**: Changes in environment can reduce territorial fixation and nesting behavior.
- **Increase activity and exercise**: Foraging, training, and out-of-cage time redirect energy.
- **Avoid reinforcing hormonal displays**: Do not respond with attention to regurgitation, masturbation, or displaying.
- **Multiple family member interaction**: Prevents intense single-person pair bonding.

### Veterinary Intervention
- **Chronic egg-laying**: Females that lay eggs persistently may need hormonal treatment (leuprolide/Lupron injections) or dietary calcium supplementation. Chronic laying depletes calcium and can lead to egg binding, osteoporosis, and death.
- **Severe aggression**: An avian veterinarian may recommend hormonal management in extreme cases.

## Health Risks of Unmanaged Hormonal Behavior

- **Chronic egg-laying**: Calcium depletion, egg binding, oviductal prolapse, peritonitis.
- **Aggression-related injury**: To the bird (thrashing) or to humans.
- **Feather destructive behavior**: Hormonal stress contributes to plucking.
- **Reproductive tract disease**: Chronic hormonal stimulation can lead to ovarian cysts, oviductal infection, and reproductive tumors.
- **Nutritional depletion**: Egg production requires significant calcium and energy.
