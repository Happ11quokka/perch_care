# Excessive Screaming

## Overview

Vocalization is a natural and essential part of parrot behavior. In the wild, parrots use loud calls for flock communication, territory defense, mate contact, and alarm signaling. In captivity, a certain amount of daily vocalization is normal and healthy. However, **excessive screaming** -- prolonged, repetitive, high-volume vocalizations that go beyond normal daily calling patterns -- is one of the most common behavioral complaints among parrot owners. Excessive screaming can strain the human-bird relationship, lead to rehoming, and often indicates unmet needs in the bird's environment.

## Normal vs. Excessive Vocalization

### Normal Vocalization Patterns
- **Dawn and dusk calling**: Most parrots vocalize loudly for 10-20 minutes at dawn and dusk. This is a deeply ingrained flock behavior and should be expected and tolerated.
- **Contact calls**: Brief calls when a family member leaves the room -- the bird is checking on flock location.
- **Excitement vocalizations**: Loud calls during play, when visitors arrive, or in response to stimulating events.
- **Singing/talking**: Practicing speech, whistling, or singing throughout the day.

### Excessive Screaming
- Continuous screaming lasting 30+ minutes beyond normal dawn/dusk periods.
- Screaming that escalates in volume and duration over time.
- Screaming in response to specific triggers (attention-seeking, boredom, frustration).
- Screaming that significantly disrupts the household.

## Species Prone to Loud Vocalization

- **Cockatoos**: Among the loudest companion parrots (up to 135 decibels for Moluccan Cockatoos). Highly prone to attention-seeking screaming.
- **Macaws**: Extremely loud natural calls. Blue-and-Gold and Scarlet Macaws are particularly vocal.
- **Conures**: Sun Conures and Jenday Conures are notorious for persistent, high-pitched calls.
- **Amazon Parrots**: Loud and vocal, especially during hormonal periods.
- **Cockatiel**: While not as loud, cockatiels can develop persistent flock-calling behavior.
- **Smaller species** (budgerigars, lovebirds): Less volume but can still develop persistent calling.

## Common Causes

### Attention-Seeking
- The most common cause. The bird has learned that screaming produces a response (even negative attention like yelling "be quiet!" reinforces the behavior).
- Any response to screaming teaches the bird that screaming works.

### Boredom and Understimulation
- Birds without adequate foraging opportunities, toys, and social interaction vocalize excessively out of frustration.
- Cage environments that are barren or unchanging contribute to boredom.

### Fear or Anxiety
- New environments, unfamiliar people, perceived predators (hawks visible through windows, cats), or sudden environmental changes.
- Separation anxiety when bonded person is absent.

### Hormonal Behavior
- Breeding season increases vocalization in many species.
- Territorial calling and mate-attraction vocalizations.

### Environmental Triggers
- Household noise: TV, music, kitchen sounds, other pets barking.
- Parrots naturally compete with ambient noise, so a loud household creates louder birds.
- Seeing other birds outside through windows.

### Medical Causes
- Pain or illness can cause increased vocalization.
- Changes in vocal quality (hoarseness, loss of voice) may indicate respiratory infection, aspergillosis, or goiter.

### Sleep Deprivation
- Birds not getting 10-12 hours of sleep are more irritable and prone to excessive screaming.

## Management Strategies

### Do NOT Do
- **Do NOT yell at the bird**: Yelling back is perceived as "flock calling" and reinforces screaming.
- **Do NOT cover the cage as punishment**: This creates fear and anxiety without addressing the cause.
- **Do NOT spray with water**: Punishment-based approaches damage trust and do not resolve the underlying issue.
- **Do NOT rehome impulsively**: Screaming is usually a solvable problem with consistent management.

### Positive Reinforcement Approach
1. **Reward quiet behavior**: When the bird is playing quietly, talking softly, or foraging, provide praise, treats, and attention. This teaches the bird that quiet behavior earns rewards.
2. **Teach an alternative vocalization**: Train the bird to use a specific contact call, whistle, or word instead of screaming. Respond consistently to this alternative.
3. **Ignore screaming** (when safe to do so): Do not enter the room, make eye contact, or speak to the bird during screaming episodes. Wait for even a brief pause, then immediately reward the silence.
4. **Respond to contact calls**: Quickly answer brief contact calls with a verbal response ("I'm here!") to satisfy the bird's flock-checking instinct before it escalates.

### Environmental Management
- **Increase foraging enrichment**: Foraging keeps the bird occupied and reduces boredom-based screaming.
- **Provide adequate social time**: Minimum 2-4 hours of direct interaction daily.
- **Manage noise levels**: Reduce competing household noise during times the bird is most vocal.
- **Ensure proper sleep**: 10-12 hours of dark, quiet sleep reduces irritability.
- **Manage hormonal triggers**: Control light exposure, remove nesting stimuli, avoid stimulatory petting.

### Routine Management
- Establish predictable daily routines so the bird knows when interaction times will occur.
- Provide enrichment activities before anticipated screaming periods.
- Pre-empt dawn/dusk screaming with foraging toys placed the night before.

## When to Seek Help

- If screaming is accompanied by other behavioral changes (plucking, aggression, lethargy).
- If screaming started suddenly without an obvious environmental change (may indicate pain or illness).
- If vocal quality has changed (hoarseness, clicking, wheezing) -- see an avian veterinarian immediately.
- If consistent behavioral management has not shown improvement after 4-6 weeks.
- Consult an avian behaviorist for severe or complex cases.
