# Self-Mutilation

## Overview

Self-mutilation in companion parrots is the most severe form of self-injurious behavior, going beyond feather plucking to involve deliberate damage to the bird's own skin, muscle, and sometimes even bone. The bird chews, picks, or tears at its own flesh, creating open wounds that can become life-threatening if not addressed. Self-mutilation represents a medical and behavioral emergency that requires immediate veterinary intervention combined with long-term behavioral and environmental management.

## Distinction from Feather Plucking

While feather plucking (FDB) involves damage to feathers, self-mutilation involves damage to the **body itself**:
- **Feather plucking**: Removal or damage to feathers. Skin remains intact.
- **Self-mutilation**: The bird chews through skin, creating open wounds, often on the chest (keel area), legs, feet, under the wings, or at the wing web. Bleeding, scabbing, and infection are common.

Self-mutilation may develop as a progression of chronic feather plucking, but it can also appear without a prior history of FDB.

## Commonly Affected Species

- **Cockatoos**: The most frequently affected group, particularly Moluccan, Umbrella, and Goffin's Cockatoos.
- **African Grey Parrots**: Prone to chronic self-mutilation, especially over the keel and legs.
- **Macaws**: Less common but can develop severe self-mutilation.
- **Eclectus Parrots**: Occasionally affected.
- **Lovebirds**: Can develop foot and leg mutilation.

## Common Locations

- **Chest/keel area**: The most common site. Birds chew through skin and muscle over the sternum.
- **Legs and feet**: Chewing at the legs, toes, or feet.
- **Under the wings**: Damage to the skin of the wing web or axillary area.
- **Crop area**: Some birds target the crop region.
- **Tail base**: Damage to the uropygial (preen) gland area.

## Medical Causes

Self-mutilation can be triggered or maintained by medical conditions:

- **Pain**: Internal pain from organ disease (liver, kidney, reproductive), air sacculitis, or musculoskeletal injury may cause the bird to attack the area of perceived discomfort.
- **Neuropathy**: Nerve damage or irritation, including from previous injuries or viral infections (Proventricular Dilatation Disease/PDD).
- **Dermatitis**: Bacterial or fungal skin infections, allergic reactions.
- **Foreign bodies**: Subcutaneous foreign bodies or microchip irritation.
- **Heavy metal toxicosis**: Zinc or lead poisoning can cause skin irritation and self-directed behavior.
- **Nutritional deficiency**: Severe vitamin A deficiency, amino acid deficiency.
- **Reproductive disease**: Ovarian cysts, egg-related peritonitis causing internal discomfort.

## Behavioral and Psychological Causes

- **Chronic stress**: Persistent environmental stressors without relief.
- **Social isolation**: Profound loneliness, particularly in highly social species (cockatoos).
- **Obsessive-compulsive disorder analog**: Self-mutilation can become a compulsive, self-reinforcing cycle.
- **Endorphin release**: The act of self-injury may trigger endorphin release, creating a physiological reward cycle.
- **Trauma history**: Birds with a history of neglect, abuse, or multiple rehomings.
- **Anxiety disorders**: Severe separation anxiety or generalized anxiety.
- **Learned behavior**: Attention (even medical attention) following self-injury can inadvertently reinforce the behavior.

## Emergency First Aid

If a bird is actively bleeding from self-mutilation:
1. **Apply direct pressure** with a clean cloth or gauze.
2. **Apply styptic powder or cornstarch** to the wound if accessible.
3. **Keep the bird warm and calm** -- blood loss leads to shock quickly in birds.
4. **Transport to an avian veterinarian immediately**. Self-mutilation wounds can be life-threatening.
5. **Do NOT attempt to bandage** complex wounds at home -- improper bandaging can restrict breathing.

## Veterinary Treatment

- **Wound management**: Cleaning, suturing, and bandaging of wounds.
- **Antibiotics**: For secondary bacterial infections.
- **Pain management**: Analgesics (meloxicam, tramadol) to address pain that may be contributing.
- **Physical barriers**: Elizabethan collars, tube collars, or body wraps to prevent access to wounds while they heal. These are temporary measures only.
- **Psychotropic medications**: Haloperidol, fluoxetine, or other medications may be prescribed for severe compulsive cases.
- **Hormonal management**: Leuprolide (Lupron) injections if reproductive hormones are contributing.
- **Diagnostic workup**: Blood work, radiographs, endoscopy to identify underlying medical triggers.

## Behavioral and Environmental Management

- **Do not rely solely on physical barriers** (collars). They prevent wound access but do not address the cause. Removing the collar without addressing underlying issues leads to immediate resumption.
- **Increase social interaction significantly**: Self-mutilating birds need dramatically increased social time.
- **Environmental enrichment**: Extensive foraging opportunities, destructible toys, varied textures.
- **Reduce stress**: Identify and eliminate environmental stressors.
- **Consistent routine**: Highly predictable daily schedule reduces anxiety.
- **Bathing**: Frequent misting soothes irritated skin and provides positive stimulation.
- **Sleep**: Ensure 12 hours of uninterrupted dark sleep.
- **Positive reinforcement**: Heavily reward any non-destructive activity. Never punish self-mutilation (punishment increases stress and worsens the behavior).

## Prognosis

- Self-mutilation is **extremely difficult to resolve** and requires long-term, multi-modal treatment.
- Complete resolution is possible but uncommon in chronic cases.
- Many birds require lifelong management with periodic setbacks.
- Early intervention (before the behavior becomes deeply habitual) significantly improves outcomes.
- Owner commitment, an experienced avian veterinarian, and often an avian behaviorist are essential components of treatment.
- In severe cases, permanent physical barriers may be necessary for the bird's survival.
