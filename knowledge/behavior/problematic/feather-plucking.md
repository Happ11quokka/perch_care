# Feather Plucking (Feather Destructive Behavior)

## Overview

Feather plucking, more accurately termed **feather destructive behavior (FDB)**, refers to a bird damaging, pulling out, chewing, or barbering its own feathers beyond normal preening. FDB is one of the most common and frustrating behavioral problems in companion parrots, affecting an estimated 10-17.5% of captive psittacines. It is rarely seen in wild parrots, strongly suggesting that captive environmental and social conditions are primary contributing factors. FDB ranges in severity from mild over-preening (frayed feather edges) to complete self-denudation of accessible body areas.

## Affected Species

While any parrot species can develop FDB, the following are most commonly affected:
- **African Grey Parrots**: Among the most frequently affected species due to their high intelligence and sensitivity.
- **Cockatoos**: Extremely prone, particularly Moluccan and Umbrella Cockatoos.
- **Eclectus Parrots**: Frequently affected, often linked to dietary issues.
- **Macaws**: Particularly Blue-and-Gold and Scarlet Macaws.
- **Amazon Parrots**: Less commonly affected than Greys and Cockatoos but still at risk.
- **Conures**: Occasionally affected, particularly when under-stimulated.

## Types of Feather Destructive Behavior

- **Feather plucking**: Complete removal of feathers by pulling them out at the base.
- **Feather chewing/barbering**: Chewing feather vanes, leaving ragged or shortened feathers still attached.
- **Feather shredding**: Shredding the vanes of feathers while leaving the shaft intact.
- **Over-preening**: Excessive but not destructive preening that causes mild feather damage.
- **Self-mutilation**: The most severe form, where the bird damages skin and underlying tissue (see self-mutilation.md).

## Important Diagnostic Note

**Head feathers**: Since birds cannot reach their own head feathers, loss of head feathers typically indicates a **medical** cause (PBFD, mites, bacterial/fungal infection, polyomavirus) rather than behavioral FDB. This is a key diagnostic distinction.

## Medical Causes (Must Rule Out First)

A thorough veterinary examination is essential before assuming behavioral causes:

- **Infectious**: PBFD (Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease), bacterial folliculitis, fungal dermatitis, internal parasites (Giardia).
- **Allergic/Inflammatory**: Allergic dermatitis, contact irritation.
- **Nutritional**: Vitamin A deficiency, amino acid deficiency, malnutrition from seed-only diets.
- **Hormonal**: Hypothyroidism, reproductive hormone imbalances.
- **Toxic**: Heavy metal poisoning (zinc, lead), environmental toxins, cigarette smoke.
- **Dermatological**: Dry skin from low humidity, xanthomas.
- **Pain**: Internal organ disease causing referred discomfort (liver disease, air sacculitis).

## Behavioral and Environmental Causes

- **Social deprivation**: Insufficient interaction, isolation, loss of a companion (human or avian).
- **Boredom/understimulation**: Lack of foraging opportunities, toys, and mental enrichment.
- **Sleep deprivation**: Less than 10-12 hours of dark, quiet sleep per night.
- **Stress**: Environmental changes, new household members, moving, loud environments.
- **Sexual frustration**: Hormonal stimulation without a mate or appropriate outlet.
- **Anxiety**: Separation anxiety, fear of specific stimuli.
- **Early developmental factors**: Hand-rearing without adequate socialization, early weaning.
- **Learned behavior**: FDB can become a habitual, self-reinforcing behavior (similar to obsessive-compulsive disorder in humans).

## Diagnosis

1. **Complete avian veterinary exam**: Physical examination, feather and skin evaluation.
2. **Blood work**: CBC, chemistry panel to assess organ function and nutritional status.
3. **PBFD testing**: PCR test to rule out Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease.
4. **Crop/fecal analysis**: To rule out Giardia, bacterial, or yeast infections.
5. **Radiographs**: To identify internal organ disease.
6. **Heavy metal testing**: Blood zinc and lead levels.
7. **Skin/feather biopsy**: If dermatological disease is suspected.
8. **Behavioral history**: Detailed assessment of environment, diet, social interaction, sleep schedule, and onset triggers.

## Treatment

### Medical Treatment
- Treat any identified underlying medical condition.
- **Nutritional correction**: Convert to balanced pellet-based diet with appropriate fresh foods.
- **Medications** (prescribed by avian veterinarian):
  - Haloperidol or other psychotropic medications for severe, refractory cases.
  - Hormonal treatments if reproductive hormones are a factor.
  - Anti-anxiety medications in some cases.
- **Collars/vests**: Physical barriers (Elizabethan collars, body vests) may be used temporarily to allow feather regrowth, but they do not address the underlying cause and can increase stress.

### Environmental and Behavioral Treatment
- **Increase social interaction**: Minimum 2-4 hours of direct interaction daily.
- **Foraging enrichment**: Provide foraging toys, puzzles, and opportunities to work for food.
- **Bathing**: Regular misting or shallow baths improve skin and feather condition and provide enrichment.
- **Sleep hygiene**: Ensure 10-12 hours of undisturbed sleep nightly.
- **Reduce hormonal triggers**: Limit daylight hours, remove nesting sites, avoid stimulatory petting.
- **Environmental enrichment**: Rotate toys frequently, provide variety in perches and textures.
- **Positive reinforcement**: Reward the bird for appropriate preening and other desired behaviors. Do NOT punish or draw attention to plucking.
- **Routine and predictability**: Establish consistent daily routines to reduce anxiety.
- **Consider avian companionship**: In some cases, a compatible avian companion may help, though this must be carefully evaluated.

## Prognosis

- FDB caught early, before it becomes a deeply ingrained habit, has the best prognosis.
- Chronic, long-term plucking is very difficult to resolve completely.
- Damaged feather follicles may never regrow feathers, even after the behavior stops.
- Improvement is often measured in reduced plucking rather than complete cessation.
- Multi-modal approach (medical, dietary, environmental, behavioral) yields the best outcomes.
- Owner commitment and patience are essential -- improvement may take months to years.
