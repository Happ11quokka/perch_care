# Biting & Aggression

## Overview

Biting is one of the most common reasons companion parrots are surrendered, rehomed, or neglected. However, it is important to understand that **parrots do not bite without reason**. In the wild, parrots rarely bite each other -- they use body language, vocalizations, and displacement behaviors to resolve conflicts. Biting in captivity almost always indicates that the bird's earlier, subtler communication signals (body language) were not recognized or were ignored, or that the bird has learned that biting is the only effective way to communicate its needs. Understanding the motivations behind biting is the key to prevention and resolution.

## Types of Biting Behavior

### Exploratory Beaking
- Young birds and newly acquired birds use their beaks to explore their environment, similar to human infants using their mouths.
- This is **not** aggression -- it is gentle "tasting" and testing of objects and people.
- If met with overreaction (pulling away, yelling), the bird may learn that beak contact produces exciting reactions, reinforcing harder biting.

### Pressure Biting
- A moderate squeeze that is not intended to cause harm, used as communication (e.g., "I don't want to do that" or "put me down").
- Important to differentiate from true aggressive biting.

### Aggressive Biting
- A hard, intentional bite meant to drive away a perceived threat. Usually accompanied by warning body language (eye pinning, feather fluffing, lunging).
- Can cause significant injury, especially from larger species.

### Displacement Biting
- A bite directed at the nearest available target when the bird is aroused by something else (e.g., seeing a rival bird, hearing a startling noise, and biting the person holding them).
- The handler is not the cause but becomes the target.

## Common Causes of Biting

### Fear
- The most common cause of biting, especially in new birds or birds with limited socialization.
- Fear bites are defensive -- the bird feels cornered or threatened and bites to escape.
- Triggers: unfamiliar people, sudden movements, toweling, veterinary handling, new objects.

### Territorial Aggression
- Defending cage, favorite perch, or bonded person.
- Often intensified during hormonal periods.
- See territorial-behavior.md for detailed information.

### Hormonal Aggression
- Seasonal breeding behavior increases aggression in many species.
- Amazon parrots are particularly known for severe hormonal aggression ("Amazon hot spots").
- Signs: eye pinning, tail fanning, wing display, lunging, unpredictable attacks.
- See hormonal-behavior.md for management strategies.

### Overstimulation
- A bird that is being handled, petted, or played with beyond its comfort level.
- The bird's body language escalates (eye pinning, feather slicking, fidgeting) before it bites.
- Learning to read the bird's "I've had enough" signals prevents overstimulation bites.

### Frustration
- A bird that wants something it cannot have, or is being prevented from doing something it wants to do.
- Common during training when the bird is confused or the session is too long.

### Pain or Illness
- A bird in pain may bite when handled, especially if touched in the area of discomfort.
- Sudden onset of biting in a previously gentle bird warrants veterinary examination.

### Learned Behavior
- If biting consistently produces the desired result (being put down, being left alone, exciting reactions), the bird learns that biting is effective communication.
- Inadvertent reinforcement is the most common way biting becomes habitual.

## Species-Specific Considerations

- **Amazon Parrots**: Known for "no warning" bites, especially during hormonal periods. Experienced Amazon owners learn to read extremely subtle cues.
- **Cockatoos**: Can inflict severe bites. Often related to overstimulation or frustrated bonding needs.
- **Macaws**: Extremely powerful beaks capable of causing serious injury. Bites are often territorial or hormonal.
- **African Greys**: May develop fear-based biting. Known for being one-person birds and biting others.
- **Conures**: Frequent "nippy" behavior that can escalate if not addressed. Often overstimulation-related.

## Prevention

- **Learn body language**: The single most effective bite prevention. Recognize warning signals (eye pinning, feather position, posture changes) and respond before the bird resorts to biting.
- **Respect "no"**: When a bird leans away, turns its back, or gives warning body language, respect that communication. Do not force interaction.
- **Step-up training**: A well-trained step-up provides a structured, positive way to handle the bird without confrontation.
- **Avoid punishment**: Never hit, flick, shake, or yell at a bird for biting. This increases fear and aggression.
- **Avoid "earthquake" response**: Dropping or shaking the hand when bitten teaches the bird that biting produces dramatic results.
- **Manage hormonal periods**: Reduce hormonal triggers during breeding season.
- **Socialize broadly**: Birds interacted with by multiple family members are less likely to develop one-person aggression.

## Addressing Established Biting

1. **Identify the trigger**: Observe when biting occurs -- during cage approach? When handling? When a specific person is present? During specific times of day?
2. **Remove or modify the trigger**: If possible, eliminate or change the circumstances that lead to biting.
3. **Neutral territory training**: Work with the bird away from its cage in a neutral location where it is less defensive.
4. **Positive reinforcement training**: Use clicker training and treats to build trust and teach alternative behaviors.
5. **Target training**: Teaching the bird to touch a target stick redirects beak contact to an appropriate object.
6. **Gradual desensitization**: For fear-based biting, gradually expose the bird to the feared stimulus at sub-threshold levels while pairing with positive rewards.
7. **Patience and consistency**: Behavioral change takes weeks to months. All family members must respond consistently.

## When to Seek Professional Help

- If biting is causing injury to family members.
- If a bird becomes unhandleable.
- If biting onset is sudden and may indicate pain or illness (veterinary exam first).
- If behavioral interventions have not improved the situation after 6-8 weeks of consistent effort.
- Consult a certified avian behaviorist (International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants -- IAABC).
