# Stereotypic Behavior

## Overview

Stereotypic behaviors (also called stereotypies) are repetitive, invariant behavior patterns that serve no obvious goal or function. In companion parrots, stereotypies are considered indicators of compromised welfare and chronic stress, as they are extremely rare in wild populations. These behaviors develop when a bird's physical, social, or cognitive needs are not adequately met, and the bird channels its frustration and unfulfilled motivation into repetitive motor patterns. Stereotypic behaviors are analogous to similar conditions seen in zoo animals and are recognized as a significant welfare concern in avian medicine.

## Types of Stereotypic Behavior

### Pacing and Route-Tracing
- Repetitive walking along the same path on a perch, along the cage bottom, or climbing a fixed route on the cage bars.
- The movement pattern is rigid and identical each time.
- Distinguished from normal exploration by its repetitive, fixed nature.

### Head-Bobbing and Weaving
- Rhythmic, repetitive head movements (bobbing, swaying, weaving) that are not related to feeding, communication, or excitement.
- Distinguished from normal head-bobbing (which occurs in context, such as before regurgitation, during excitement, or in juvenile begging) by being performed out of context and repetitively.

### Bar-Biting and Cage-Chewing
- Repetitive, stereotyped biting or chewing of cage bars without attempting to escape or manipulate the bars purposefully.
- Different from exploratory beaking (which is varied and goal-directed) in its rigid repetition.

### Spot-Picking
- Repeatedly picking at one specific spot on the body (often the chest or leg) in a stereotyped manner.
- May overlap with feather destructive behavior or self-mutilation but is distinguished by its repetitive, seemingly automatic nature.

### Toe-Tapping and Wing-Flipping
- Repetitive, rhythmic tapping of the toes or flicking of the wings.
- Particularly common in Eclectus Parrots, where it may be associated with dietary factors (excess vitamin supplementation, artificial additives, or nutritional imbalance).
- In other species, may indicate neurological issues or stereotypic behavior.

### Repetitive Vocalizations
- Monotonous repetition of a single sound, word, or call in a stereotyped pattern.
- Different from normal vocal practice (which varies in content and context) in its rigid, invariant repetition.

### Circling
- Repetitive walking or flying in tight circles, often on the cage floor.
- Can also indicate neurological disease (ear infection, head injury, toxicosis) and should be evaluated medically.

## Causes

### Environmental Inadequacy
- **Insufficient space**: Cages that are too small for the species.
- **Barren environment**: Lack of toys, foraging opportunities, perch variety, or visual stimulation.
- **Monotonous environment**: Same cage setup, same routine, no novel stimuli.

### Social Deprivation
- **Isolation**: Insufficient interaction with humans or other birds.
- **Single housing**: Social species kept alone without adequate human companionship.
- **Loss of companion**: Death or separation from a bonded partner (human or avian).

### Frustration of Natural Behaviors
- **Inability to fly**: Flight-capable birds in small cages without flight opportunity.
- **Inability to forage**: Food presented in bowls without any foraging challenge.
- **Inability to bathe**: No access to bathing opportunities.
- **Inability to explore**: Confined environment with nothing to investigate.

### Chronic Stress
- Persistent environmental stressors (loud household, predator-like pets, unpredictable schedule).
- History of neglect, abuse, or frequent rehoming.

### Medical Factors
- **Neurological disease**: Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD), heavy metal toxicosis, or central nervous system infection can cause repetitive behaviors that mimic stereotypies.
- **Nutritional factors**: Particularly in Eclectus Parrots, dietary imbalances have been associated with toe-tapping and wing-flipping.
- **Pain**: Chronic pain can contribute to abnormal repetitive behaviors.

## Diagnosis

1. **Veterinary examination**: Rule out medical causes (neurological disease, heavy metal toxicosis, nutritional deficiency, pain).
2. **Blood work**: CBC, chemistry panel, heavy metal levels (zinc, lead).
3. **Behavioral assessment**: Detailed evaluation of the bird's environment, social opportunities, daily routine, and history.
4. **Video documentation**: Recording the behavior for review by an avian veterinarian or behaviorist.

## Treatment

### Environmental Enrichment
- **Increase cage size**: The cage should be large enough for the bird to fully extend wings and move freely.
- **Foraging opportunities**: Provide foraging toys that require the bird to work for food. This addresses the frustration of natural foraging instincts.
- **Toy rotation**: Change toys regularly to maintain novelty. Provide a variety of textures, colors, and types (destructible, puzzle, foot toys, preening toys).
- **Perch variety**: Multiple perches of different materials, diameters, and textures.
- **Visual stimulation**: Cage placement where the bird can observe household activity, window views, or bird-safe television/music.

### Social Enrichment
- **Increase direct interaction time**: Minimum 2-4 hours daily; more for highly social species.
- **Flock inclusion**: Place the bird in a social area of the home.
- **Consider avian companionship**: For chronically isolated birds, a compatible companion bird may help (with careful introduction).
- **Training sessions**: Positive reinforcement training provides mental stimulation and social interaction.

### Behavioral Modification
- **Redirect**: When the bird begins a stereotypic behavior, offer an alternative activity (foraging toy, training session, social interaction). Do not punish the behavior.
- **Increase behavioral diversity**: Provide opportunities for a wide range of normal behaviors (flying, climbing, bathing, foraging, preening, playing).
- **Routine variation**: Introduce controlled variation in daily routines to prevent monotony.

### Medical Treatment
- Address any underlying medical conditions.
- In Eclectus Parrots with toe-tapping/wing-flipping, review diet and eliminate excess vitamin supplements and artificial additives.
- In severe cases, psychotropic medication may be considered under veterinary guidance.

## Prognosis

- Mild stereotypies caught early and addressed with environmental enrichment often improve significantly.
- Chronic, deeply ingrained stereotypies (years-long) are very difficult to eliminate completely but can often be reduced.
- Multi-modal treatment (environmental, social, and medical) provides the best outcomes.
- Prevention through appropriate housing, enrichment, and socialization from the beginning is far more effective than treating established stereotypies.
